title: "Assignment 4 - Data Wrangging with `dplyr`"
---

***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment4.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- Notice that if there is `eval=FALSE` in the first line of the code chunk, the chunk will not be execute.

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas under Assignment 4. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

-------

#### 1. Install `tidyverse` package

An R package can be installed by `install.packages` function. Install `tidyverse` if you have not done so. 

```{r}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```

-------

#### 2. Read the data using `read_csv`

Use `read_csv` function to import the US Covid 19 data at [link](https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv).  Don't forget to import `tidyverse` (library(tidyverse)) so that you can use read_csv. 
```{r}
df <- read_csv('https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv')
str(df)
```

-------

#### 3.  Fix the date and create some new variables

`lubridate` is a package of the `tidyverse` packages.  We will make uses of `lubridate` in this question.

- Use the below codes to create `month`, `weekday` and `monthday` variables

```{r}
library(lubridate)
df$month = month(df$date)

# day of the week
df$weekday = wday(df$date)

# day of the month
df$monthday <- mday(df$date)
```

-------

#### 4. Create new variables with `case_when`. 

The function `case_when` is a good option to create a new variable from existing variable.  For example, this below codes create a new variable, `daily_death`, from `deathIncrease` variable.  `deathIncrease` is the number of daily new death by Covid19.  The new variable `daily_death` takes three values:  low (if `deathIncrease` less than 3), medium (`deathIncrease` from 3 to 14), and high (`deathIncrease` more than 14).  Please notice that this can also be done in a different way as shown in Assignment 3. 

```{r}
df$daily_death <- case_when(
  df$deathIncrease <3 ~ 'low',
  df$deathIncrease <=14 ~ 'medium',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)
```

- Create variable `month2` that takes three values: early_month (day of the month from 1-10), mid_month (day of the month from 11-20), and end_month (day of the month > 20).
```{r}
df$month2 <- case_when(df$monthday <=10 ~ 'early_month', df$monthday <= 20 ~ 'mid_month', TRUE ~ 'end_month')
```


- Create variable `weekend` that takes two values:  1 if it's Saturday or Sunday or 0 otherwise. 
```{r}
df$weekend <- case_when(df$weekday == 1 ~ 'Saturday or Sunday',
                     TRUE ~ 'Weekdays')
df$weekend
```

-------

#### 5. Select function

Use the select function to deselect the column `totalTestsViral` from the data.
```{r}
df %>% select(-totalTestsViral)
```

-------

#### 6. Pipe Operator ( %>% )

Pipe operator offers another way to write R codes. Many times, it makes the codes more readable.  Pipe works very well with all the `tidyverse` packages. Refer to [these slides](../slides/4_dplyr.html#15) (slide 15, 16, 17 and 18) to rewrite the below codes using pipe operator

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)

# square root of x
sqrt(x)
#pipe
x %>% sqrt

#conventional way
sum(sqrt(x))
#sum of the square root of x using the pipe operator 
x %>% sqrt %>% sum

#conventional way
log(sum(sqrt(x)))
#pipe
x%>% sqrt %>% sum %>% log

# log base 2 of 16
log(16, 2)
#pipe
16 %>% log(2)
```

-------

#### 7. Combo 1: group_by + summarise

This combo is used when you want to apply a function/calculation to different groups of the data. For example, to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade`, we use:

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month`
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```


- Calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month2`
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(month2) %>%
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```


- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `weekend`
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(weekend) %>%
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```



-------

#### 8. Combo 2: filter + group_by + summarise

An example: to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) in January and February separately, we use:

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(month==1|month==2) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(positve_increase = mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) on the weekend by `month` in October and November 2020. 
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2020, month %in% c(10, 11), weekend == 'Saturday or Sunday') %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(median_positive_increase = median(positiveIncrease))
```


- Calculate the average number of death at different periods of a month (`month2` variable) in Fall 2020
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2020, month %in% c(9,10,11)) %>%
  group_by(month2) %>%
  summarise(average_positive_increase = mean(positiveIncrease))
```


- Compare the average number of hospitalizations between weekdays and weekends in Summer 2020
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2020, month %in% c(6,7,8)) %>%
  group_by(weekend) %>%
  summarise(average_hospitilizations = mean(hospitalized, na.rm = TRUE))
```




-------

#### 9. Combo 3: filter + group_by + summarise + arrange

Use the arrange function to find a month that has the highest number of deaths on the weekend. 
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(weekend == 'Saturday or Sunday') %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(maximum_deaths = max(death, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(maximum_deaths)
```

- Redo Questions 14 and 15 in [Assignment 3](assignment3.html) using the combos.  Notice:  you also need to use the data used in Assignment 3.  
```{r}
#datebase from assignment 3 
df1 <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv')

#question 14: find the median cases by weekdays in Rhode Island in 2021 
df1$date <- as.Date(df1$date)  

df1 %>%
  mutate(weekdays = weekdays(date)) %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2021, state == 'Rhode Island') %>%
  group_by(weekdays) %>%
  summarise(median_cases = median(cases))

#question 15: compare the median cases in Rhode Island in June, July, August and September in 2021.
df1 %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2021, state == 'Rhode Island', 
         month(date) %in% c(6, 7, 8, 9)) %>%
  group_by(month(date)) %>%
  summarise(median_cases = median(cases))
```
-------

#### 10. Use your own dataset and implement the follows functions or combos. You can use the [Adult Census Income](../data/adult_census.csv) or [Titanic data](../data/titanic.csv). 

```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\student\\OneDrive - Bryant University\\2023-2024\\Semester 1\\MATH421-A Statistical Analysis with R\\Data")
df <- read_csv('adult_census.csv')
str(df)
```


- select
```{r}
df %>% select(education, income)
```

- filter
```{r}
df %>% filter(education == 'HS-grad', income == '<=50K')
```

- mutate
```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(gain_minus_loss = capital.gain - capital.loss)
```

- summarise
```{r}
df %>% summarise(mean_education = mean(education.num, na.rm=TRUE), 
                 median_education=median(education.num, na.rm=TRUE), 
                 max_education=max(education.num, na.rm=TRUE))
```

- arrange
```{r}
df %>% arrange(-age)
```

- count
```{r}
df %>% count(workclass)
```

- count + arrange
```{r}
df %>%
  count(native.country) %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

- filter + count + arrange
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(education == "Doctorate", income == '>50K') %>%
  count(native.country) %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

- group_by + summarise
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(meanWorkingHours = mean(hours.per.week))
```

- filter + group_by + summarise
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(education.num > 5) %>% 
  group_by(workclass) %>% 
  summarise(averageEducationYears = mean(education.num))
```

- filter + group_by + summarise + arrange
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(education.num > 10) %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(averageEducationYears = mean(education.num)) %>% 
  arrange(-averageEducationYears)
```
