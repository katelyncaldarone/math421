I don't know if this is the right place to ask but, I am an incoming freshman, and I'm planning on applying abroad, my applications need counselors, and, as an international student, I'm not aware of what a 'counselor' is, is it a guidance counselor? because as far as I'm aware all we have at our schools are guidance counselors who are more of a disciplinary counselor. The Common App, which I'm using as my way of admissions needs me to invite a counselor and I really don't know who I'm supposed to ask regarding this. Do I ask one from the college I'm applying for? or the school I'm currently enrolled in? if it's the latter, do I ask my adviser guidance counselor, or academic coordinator?

I got through high school with very good grades while barely picking up books and actually sitting down to study, passed all of my exams and managed to get into every university i applied for. I always knew that it's going to get much more difficult from now on, but i still managed to remain somewhat hopeful, and now, i'm genuinely struggling. It's 100% my fault for not taking it as seriously as i should, but it's very hard to transition from the way i was in high school, and i'm stuck. I'm way behind a lot of people in my classes, and like i said, that one's on me, but it sucks. Every time i get confronted with this reality i just lose motivation, i cry almost every day just because of how humiliating it is to face the consequences of my procrastination, and i thought that this embarrassment would only make me want to try even harder, but it doesn't. I love my major and i'm genuinely interested in what i do, so i don't even think about dropping out. I don't know, i try to cheer myself up by saying that the first year is always the most difficult, but maybe it's just me coping with the fact that i'm just not a good student.

2023-10-31,1698737903,I got into a motorcycle accident on the way home from school and I'm behind on everything now.,"So basically, I (20M) was heading home from my last class and on the way home, a black SUV merged into me without any indication near the exit of the freeway which hit my front tire and sent me 8 feet up in the air hitting the concrete. (I was wearing gear) The guy who hit me ran off.. An ambulance picked me up and sent to the hospital with fractured body parts and a dislocated shoulder. It was a shit show because they never found the dude but I kept up a smile and a good attitude so I don't need people worrying so much about it. I took about a 2 week break before heading back and talked to the health faculty for cases like this. I talked to my professors and everything. All I had to do was catch up. Well, at first it was okay and I slowly built a repetition of schooling again until more recently, the haunting feeling of my depression began eating at me. I became mentally drain with everything I do, and more physically and mentally fatigue as the hours went by. I would just stress over everything. The more the week went by, the more I felt like I'm the burden of my family with my medical bills and my professors becoming annoyed of me for constantly asking for old assignments that keeps stacking over me.

2023-10-31,1698725959,Should I quit my job at 24 and go back to school to be an engineer?,"To give some back story, I am 24 years old, with an associates degree in forestry. Im working as a forest tech/manager. 

Im struggling to decide what to do. I feel like I hate my career. The bad days are starting to out number the good. I had doubts about my career choice, even when I was in college still. There are major things I dont like about my job. I dont like that there isnt much challenge for me anymore. I dont like that this job brings me away from home more often than not. This makes it hard to have an active social life, and is hard on my relationship as well. I also dont like that this job requires me to live in a smaller city, as that is where the work is the majority of the time. My job is very physically demanding, which can be nice sometimes,  but it also stops me from doing things that I love outside of work as Im too physically tired (lifting weights, hiking, skiing). Most of all, I dont feel as though I am living up to my potential. I remember being so hopeful for my future, and what I would accomplish. Now I feel dread. The idea of following this career path for even the next 2 years scares the hell out of me. I feel like Im giving up so much of my young life for a career I dont even want. There isnt much more room for advancement for me either at this point, Im basically at the cap of salary that I will make in this line of work, and Ive only been working in this field for three years. Another thing that I dont like, is I could get a job where I would be home every night, but I would make approximately 20 000 less a year. I want to have kids in my lifetime, and Ive realized that this job is not going to be ideal for that. 

Im struggling, because I feel like it is too late for me to start over with a new career. At the same time, Id rather be 30 with a job I like, than be regretting not making the leap. The reason I havent given up on forestry yet is because it pays the bills and then some. I make a comfortable amount of money (~65k per year). 

Im heavily considering going to get an engineering degree. I was very interested in engineering when I was choosing what to take in school, but never pursued it because I wanted to get school done quickly so I could make money sooner and get out of a toxic living situation. I love the challenge of school and learning new things. While it scares me to think about starting over, I also cant stop fantasizing about getting out of this profession and into something else. Something more fulfilling, higher paying, and hopefully better work life balance

I have to choose where to live in between dorm and the sharehouse of a flat.

It would be worthy to live in the dorm to have a new experience in US (I'm from abroad). But I'm really worried about the dirty roommates or shared bathrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

Meal plan+dorm fee costs about $2000 more than the share house, and the reviews for the meal plan tell it sucks. But I'm worried if would it be good to have an experience of US's dorm life. And I wonder if I can make a lot of new friends though I live out of the campus. It takes 15minutes to walk from the campus to the share house.

&amp;#x200B;

I will use the living room which was made like a room by using a partition if I choose the share house. And I can freely cook. This is the point why I'm hesitating. I want to save money as much as possible.

&lt;Sharehouse&gt;    

1. 15 minutes walk from school. 10th floor    
2.  Share it with 3 people (who are Asian) including me  
3. Air fryers, rice cookers, and other cooking utensils 
4. Can stay from January to the end of May    
5. I use a room entirely, it's a bit spacious (but I don't have a door because I'm using it as my room with a partition in the living room, but the partition is instead!)    
6. Easy to use the kitchen  
7. Share the bathroom with another Japanese friend    


&lt;Dormitory&gt;    

1. If I go in, I think I'll go into a double room    
2. Meal plan required (about $2,800...) But I'm not sure if I can change it to $1,000 cheaper than that.    
3. If you meet good exchange students, you can be best friends with your roommate  
4.  I'm worried that I might be suffering from meeting someone weird or dirty      
5. Toilet and shower  should be shared.
6. Easy to make friends.

2023-10-31,1698718297,Are you an adult thinking about going to college for the first time? Save a pile of money with CLEP and self study,"If you are an adult thinking about going to college for the first time, it's likely you have a lot of doubts about whether you can even do the work. The doubts get stronger the further you get from high school. If you weren't a great student in high school, you are probably even more concerned.  
  
Try college out for free by taking CLEP credits. CLEP is short for College-Level Examination Program. Basically, you self-study and then you go and take a proctored exam at either an exam center or university testing center. Usually these exams are about $93 to take plus the local exam fee which is usually around $20 or so. The list of subjects is here: https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-exams  
  
The big issue with CLEP is that you often don't know what CLEP exams your local college will accept until after you take the exam and apply. In other words, you could spend the $93 and have nothing to show for it depending on your local university's policy.  
  
You can mitigate that risk by using free CLEP study materials at Modern States. Website here: https://modernstates.org/  
  
Depending on funding, they offer free CLEP exam certificates if you use their study materials and completely study for the exam. That's a free $93 exam. You just have to pay the local testing fee and sometimes they will even reimburse that. The available CLEP study material is listed here: https://modernstates.org/course/  
  
Another caveat is that often colleges will only accept credits you earned prior to enrollment. In other words, if you sign up for college and then take CLEP, some colleges will only accept the CLEP you had completed before enrollment. If you are already enrolled, speak to a guidance counselor about whether or not you can add CLEP credits.  
  
I went back to school at 37 because I was tired of earning $15 an hour. It had been a long time since high school, so I also used Khan Academy to relearn basic math before I even started any CLEP math.  
  
I have a grad degree today with only $7k in student loan debt and a job in accounting earning $70k in a LCOL.

  
PS- I posted this in r/highereducation AND r/education and they both immediately removed it. They do not want you to save money on college at all.. lol

2023-10-31,1698714575,My best friend has another best friend :/,"My  best friend at college and I decided to become roommates this year. We  became super close freshman year and hung out all the time.   Around the  end of last year, he made a new friend (lets call him X) who he hung  out with occasionally, and so did I. Theyre both from the same country  and share the same culture and sense of humour. Even though, Id say im  fairly whitewashed because of American media, im not actually from the  states and i dont usually get all the references they talk about.

Regardless,  we were best friends last year because there was unsaid understanding.  Since we moved into our place this year, X has been coming over almost  every day and staying over most nights too.

This  means my friend now barely ever talks to me or is even interested in  telling me about stuff unless I force myself into their conversation.

Which  I absolutely hate doing because even when im in the three people  group, theyre usually the ones talking by themselves and if i chime in  with something, maybe a witty remark, they look at me like i said  something insane and lok at each other and giggle. All this while they  laugh their asses off while talking to each other.

I never hang out with just him anymore because he would always want to have X around as well if were doing something fun.

My  friend thinks i have a lot of other friends too while in reality all of  those friends are merely just acquaintances who also have closer  friends than me.

This has been  going on since the start of this year and it feels like with every  passing week im just straying further and further away.

It is not entirely my fault (I think),"I've been slowly getting a bad cold for a couple of days now and was up all night with intense coughing and aches and pains. I emailed my professor at 6 a.m. because I knew I was not going to be well enough to attend our 1-4 p.m. class. I wrote in the email that I understood that we had an online, in-person quiz today and that I would make myself available whenever it worked best for him, assuming that he needed to proctor or schedule a proctor. I don't hear from him the entire day, but notice he must be on his computer because I see him uploading other coursework to our student portal. At 1 pm exactly, I received a notification that the quiz link was shared with me. I did not open the quiz because I did not think I was allowed to take it. At 1:05, he emailed me that I must start the quiz right that second and that I must submit it by 1:30 p.m. or I will receive a zero. Knowing how quizzes work in the past with this professor, I know that once he enters the classroom on quiz day he logs onto his laptop and tells everyone to be prepared to open the quiz link the moment the clock hits 1 p.m. and we have 30 minutes to take the quiz. Since he emailed me later, I was already at a disadvantage starting a 30-question quiz 5 minutes later than everyone else. I was also caught off guard because I was nervous to submit it even the slightest bit past 1:30 p.m. and had no clue that I would be taking the quiz right then in there. I understand that it would be a possibility, but I just found it a bit unprofessional notifying me the moment I needed to begin. My issue is what if I was not actively checking my email, or if my sickness prevented me from taking the quiz? I did not disclose the extent of my illness so how was he to know I was able to complete the quiz at that time? 

By the end of the quiz, I was filling in random answers because I was running out of time. Although I submitted the quiz at 1:28 p.m. (because I was nervous about submitting it too late), I did very poorly. I received a 58%. Additionally, this professor does not have any section within his syllabus that has the course grading/weights for assignments (he also does not include any information about missing classes/exams for sickness, etc.). Considering that we are almost at the end of the semester and there is a total of 3 assignments/quizzes and 3 more to take, I figure that this quiz weighs high and will completely ruin my good grade.

i am a freshman in community college part time and only take two classes. i want to leave one because this class requires me to think more (it is statistics) and i recently lost a family member that delayed me big time- slowing down my original pace, etc.

my statistics professor is.. okay, i guess. she's not good but she's not great either. 3.5 on rmp. i am currently studying for an exam that has so much material in it that i've been confusing terms in it all the time. the exam is this week, but whats also due this week is an entire lesson that's not included in this exam, but the next.
i am suspected to have a learning disability, so all this material has been overwhelming me and i can't keep up. it doesn't help that my professor has been limiting us from using calculators, requiring we use the very long and time consuming formulas that are in her lectures. this is getting to be very hard to learn and memorize.

i want to withdraw because i know i'm not gonna pass the upcoming exam, i just know it. i'd rather have a W than an F. i was told by financial aid office that my financial aid won't be affected, but it puts me in financial aid warning, and brings my completion grade down to a 50% rather than the 67% that is required to keep financial aid going. i also need to maintain a 2.0 GPA, otherwise i go into suspension. (the 6 credits minimum also isn't a worry, as the composition class i'm taking covers that.)

i have broke down multiple times over my situation because nobody has actually properly helped me in my personal life, so i'm turning to reddit. do you guys think i should just withdraw to save myself the trouble? i'm not a bad student, i had plans to finish both classes with passing grades but one class got to be too much, and i have no doubts i'll pass my next classes, as i only need one mathematics credit. any help is great, thanks.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17k7axj/needing_help_regarding_withdrawals_urgent/

2023-10-30,1698705264,Masters Decision Oxbridge/LSE vs HSG/ETH vs Sciences Po," Hello everyone,

I have the following problem: I'm soon facing the choice of pursuing my Master's degree and need to make a decision.

Here are the options:

* Master's in Economics at Oxbridge/LSE
* Quantitative Economics/Finance (Miqef) at HSG
* Quantitative Finance at ETH/Uni Zurich
* International Economic Policy at Sciences Po (a bit different from the above options, but I also find the program very interesting)

A little about me:

* I completed my Bachelor's in Economics at a good/state university in a European country, with a good university and high school GPA, and a good GRE score.
* I speak German.
* I've done a few internships in (management/economic) consulting, although not with major companies.
* I had an internship at the EIB Bank in development financing.
* I have experience working in a developing country.
* I'm hoping to do another internship, with a bank, ideally in Trading/Sales/Economic Research.

My goal(s): I would like to work in the financial sector in a role that allows me to explore my interest in macroeconomics and overall economic trends. I see potential job opportunities in areas like Macro Research &amp; Strategy at a bank, Commodities Trading, Sovereigns Coverage, etc. In terms of location, I am flexible, I would be open to working in DACH, but London is obv is also tempting.

However, I would also like to keep the possibility of a PhD open (in Europe is fine, does not have to be the US/UK).

From conversations with alumni, I'm relatively confident that I can get into the mentioned programs (except possibly ETH, but there's a chance there too). The question is, which of the above programs is the best choice.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have the feeling that UK Masters in Economics make the most sense primarily for an academic career in the UK/US, and might not necessarily pay off for other jobs. The cost would be around 40-60k, which is a very significant amount for me. Does anyone have experience with these programs? Does an Economics Master's in the UK really offer such great job prospects? It seems to me that most graduates primarily go into economic consulting, which wouldn't be worth such a significant investment for me...
* Does anyone have experience with the Miqef Master at HSG? Is it recommendable? Is the Quantitative Finance Master at ETH/UZ better regarded by banks/companies? Or is it relatively irrelevant to employers? I know that in the German speaking area, the choice of university is traditionally way less important than e.g. in the UK.
* Finally, is the Master's program at Sciences Po a good choice for a Bachelor's graduate in Economics, or is it more of a political science program with an economics touch? Can you find a good job in France if you don't speak fluent French? How good is this programme for a career in e.g. sovereign ratings research?

2023-10-30,1698698689,Spring Semester,"Hi! I graduated this year but did not attend college in the fall. I moved states to live with a family member. Its been great but the out of state tuition was just way more than i expected and i was not willing to take out a loan for almost 10k. 

Im deciding to move back to my original state to start college for the spring semester. This is where things get tricky. 

1. Will I still be a resident in my original state? I put my out of state address on my FAFSA. Can this be undone? Will it affect me in my original state?

2. My AFC (family contribution) for FAFSA is too high for me to receive any financial aid. Neither of my parents are willing to help me pay for college, so im depending on FAFSA and scholarships. Neither of which i have at the moment. Any scholarships or grants I can apply for to receive for the spring semester?

3. Is living on campus wise or is getting an apartment cheaper? I dont have a guaranteed place to return to in my original state and i feel like college would take up a lot of my time and itd be extremely hard for me to hold down a job and pay rent.

I enrolled at a local university in an MBA program.

Shortly after getting enrolled they told me that the $18K would be distributed throughout the whole program and could not all be applied to my first semester. 

I was already dropped from my only class that I was enrolled in. So I told them I could not afford it and would not be attending. The end. Or so I thought. Now theyre trying to tell me I owe them $1800 for a class that I did not attend. Has anyone experienced this? Any tips?

What I don't understand it, why when first submitted, the exam was graded out of 105 and not 100. It seems to me the extra credit questions are being used against us and no for us, meaning since they're ec, they should not be counted towards the ""out of points"" and should be added to your what you scored points-if that makes sense.

2023-11-01,1698810389,Guys I think my roommate is secretly a moth,"So when I first met him he seemed like a cool dude, typical freshman college student from the way he acts to the way he dresses. During the move in he brought a couple of things including a desk lamp, understandable it's not necessary because our desk have a lamp built into it but still. Fast forward a couple of weeks and he brings in another lamp, OK weird but I asked him and he said that he just liked them so I left it. Then he brings in some candles, they're not allowed in our dorm but I left it since they were nice. A month afterwords he brings in a floor lamp that has RGB or something. 

Now normally I probably wouldn't really care about that I have a lot of headphones for example so I just assumed that this is some weird hobby he has, except for the fact that when ever he is here he turns on all of the lamps and lights all of the candles. I swear I think I've seen him open some of his drawers and I've seen some lights in there. It takes like 10 minutes for him to turn everything off.

2023-11-01,1698809889,I suck at writing,"I'm a sophomore, and I was really never taught how to write properly. The way that I write is the way I talk, and my sister always tells me that that is not a good thing to do. When it comes to punctuation and grammar, I'm average with that, but when it comes to finding the right words, structure, or storytelling/information telling, I suck at it. . Like I said before, I write the way I talk so I tend to explain things as simple as I can. I can summarize something in 1 or 2 sentences. I can't stretch it out into 2-3 paragraphs.

The reason to why I'm making this post is because I received an essay back today, and I got a 65 on it. I talked to my professor before about how I'm not a good writer, but he thinks that my writing was written by ChatGPT. Then he went on about how you can tell something is written by ChatGPT because of the sentence length, structure, not repetitive, etc. But I feel that someone who is bad at writing and AI written text look the same because both have no structure and just doesn't make sense on its own. Also, AI does better the more information that you give it, and if you know what to give AI exactly, it's going to produce better writing than someone who's bad at writing. I even got my sister to look over that essay and she said that it's bad because I don't know how to write properly. 

Another main issue with my writing is that I don't like reading books. I consider myself to be more of a shape-rotator than a word cell. So I don't like reading books. I feel like every book is written the same. I use Grammarly to try and fix my essay's but it's just too bad that it can't be fixed. In my honest opinion, I don't think my writing is bad. Like I said before, I write the way I talk, so I tend to explain things as simple as I can. I can summarize something in 1 or 2 sentences. I can't stretch it out into 2-3 paragraphs. But what happens with that is that other people dont understand what Im trying to say. Ive been asked before to be a Calculus tutor but I declined it because I have a hard time explaining things to for so that they understand. I understand the concepts in my class, but I dont have a way to show people that in form of writing. If this class had exams instead of papers, then I would be doing so much better because I have a good memory. But I cant write to save my life.  

So what should I do? Should I try and talk to my professor again and tell him that Im not a good writer again. Should I try to continue to look up how to become a better writer? Should I show my professor my essays that I wrote before ChatGPT came out? 

Im honestly worried about how Im going to do in this class. The class is a discussion class but there are 6 papers for the semester, and we get the prompt for the paper the week before it's due. I'm doing well in my other classes because I'm a STEM major, and it doesn't involve writing essays. I just want to get a good grade in this class.

I also have my slightly easier courses this term. I'm honestly not sure when I'll ever get a semester like this again. 

But despite all of this i'm finding that I'm taking things WAY too lightly now and not rlly taking advantage of the free time the way I should be. I keep putting off things to the VERY last minute, I get this is a common issue amongst many students, but I've been doing it way more often. I've even turned in two assignments late (with a penalty ofc). And not only assignments, studying for exams has been terrible for me, consistently studying a day or two before the test is NOT something I'm proud of. 

I think I have this mentality that since I have so much free time I could just wait to do things later.. 

I want to be using my free time to study more and study ahead, to complete my assignments well in advance. And not even just academically speaking but joining clubs could be quite beneficial for me as well. I really feel like I could be achieving a lot this semester if I use my time wisely... but i'm not.

Im awaiting my PSAT score and a practice ACT score, Ill take the one that counts in February. All standardized/state tests have placed me well above average in English and average/occasionally slightly below in math.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this and if so to what extent? Is this common?

Despite this I was told that I am denied the right to extend test time or assignment time during flare-ups/to mitigate these issues at their peak on the grounds that it is not ""impossible"" for me if I just ""work harder"". After my appeal I have been told that extending test time would not help my issues of comprehension (which I feel it would, as struggles to comprehend the test material/focus takes away time? Lol?

They also told me professors give adequate time for assignments and essentially I need to manage my time better (which I already DO!).

During mental health flareups and between ADHD issues there are times where I do need that extra time between multiple assignments and multiple classes.

Yesterday I opened up my computer and saw that I received an extremely low score(15.5/100, the average  score was 60)in a programming midterm exam. To be fair, that was my fault as I did not balance my time well and spent too much time on more difficult assessments instead of going through exam content. It is a second year course too. I got frustrated and upset. In the beginning, I thought about just keeping quiet and not bursting out but then a few minutes I couldn't take it so I told my parents. Then, I cried in my room really terribly to the point that everyone can hear. This made my Father stressed and he got extremely angry about the fact and told me he won't speak to me for one week to make me learn that parents have their own issues too and cannot get stressed about adult children (Tbh, I have complained to him and expressed frustration immaturely a lot of times over the past year about my low scores and low GPA). That is my fault and I do not know how to cope. I feel angry back towards my Father but those feelings of anger do not make sense when I was wrong here.

 Honestly, complaining to them has been a coping mechanism for me and I do not know any other way to react to such low results other than being emotional about it. I have too much stress over this issue and that I have to at least pass this course.

My story starts when I moved abroad for University, but before that, a little backstory. In high school, I usually used to be first in class, not necessarily all A+ but overall the top student. However, with uni, my whole life changed. I feel like I became stumped. I don't understand things in class, am so lazy, and can't read before class. In fact, I get left behind in the first week. I don't attend the majority of the classes because I don't understand things in class anyway, so I feel bad. In high school, there has been no day I failed to understand things in class and missed class. I don't go back to watch the videos on time, and they keep piling up. When it comes to exams, I start studying a day or two before the exam when I literally have no idea what has been taught in class. Obviously, I keep failing them. I have become accustomed to getting around 30% in exams, and I feel so ashamed of myself. My CGPA is 2.0 now, and I'm in the 3rd year. I don't know who to ask for help. I don't attend office hours because I don't want anyone to see how stumped I am. Because if I am to ask for something to be explained to me, it means everything that has been taught since day one has to be explained. I sometimes don't care if I have an assignment due or an exam coming, I feel so numb. I feel utterly disgusted by myself and my actions after every exam and after every deadline, yet I can't make a single change. I used to care so much about my exams in high school, but now I don't. I used to be a good in math, but now basic things seem impossible. I never doubted myself academically more than now. I don't understand what questions are asking very well.

hi, im in community college planning to transfer to a state college asap. my major is middle level education: english/language arts. originally, my plan was to finish my classes in Summer 2024. but, since speaking with an advisor from the school, I have a lot more classes to take and a lot havent counted for credit at all. this is now my 3rd year at the school, and im worried I wont receive financial aid in the long run if I dont complete community college within 3 years.

2023-10-31,1698778373,I cant pick a major for the life of me and its freaking me out,"I have always been someone who swore by sciences and wanted to head into the direction of life sciences. From a young age, I dreamed of being a veterinarian or a surgeon, and working with people or animals in medicine. This has been my career goal since the end of my 11th grade. 

However, things have recently changed. In my last year of high school, Ive discovered that I really enjoy history and English. I enjoy reading and analyzing texts, and it comes naturally to me. This is the same for all essay writing and research papers within the humanities domain. 

I also had to drop out of physics due to the challenge of trying to understand the concepts. I got a tutor to try to learn the material and tried my best to keep doing practice problems, and still received a 61 on my final exam. Though I found the subject interesting I simply couldnt get the hang of it when it came to test time.

This has made me question whether or not I should still pursue the sciences. Although I still envision myself in careers relating to psychology, biology and chemistry, I also see myself in careers related to history and political science. The choice has been weighing down on me for a while now since applications are coming up.

What do I do when my favourite courses are biology, history and English? What do I do when humanities come easily to me but sciences are what fascinate me? I like both but simply cant decide. Advice?

2023-10-31,1698776319,I feel like an idiot,"Jokes on me for procrastinating till the last minute. Long story short, I have an online class that the instructor thought it would be a great idea to have a debate at the end of the year. Not my first time with the instructor, but last semester she was a lot more diligent in reminding us about the steps of the debate and whatnot. Something I need because I'm the type of person who forgets whether or not I took my medication. The instructions were posted at the beginning of the semester, I gave them a brief once over and then never looked again (mainly because I forgot they existed), and today the outline of the debate was due, which is the first time we had to turn in an outline. 

I didn't know about it until today when I looked in the weekly folder to see what was due, because she still has the due date being sometime in the summer, so it didn't pop up as ""due soon."" So, when I turned it in, it of course says ""Late."" No big deal, I can't control that. 

However, while I was working on the outline, I was rereading the instructions for the debate and saw a small section where it stated we were to inform her of our stance at the end of the second unit, four weeks ago. I had skipped over it the first time, and nowhere in the second unit did it state we were to inform her of our stance. She didn't even send out an email as a reminder as she had during last semester. I don't know if any of my classmates emailed her either. She didn't make any sort of note on any of the coursework I've turned in since then to remind me either. As far as I know, the email isn't graded, it was just for her to gain an understanding on our positioning on the debate. Regardless, I can't do anything about it now.

As I mentioned, I did the outline and turned it in. Not my best work, I forgot to include a conclusion like an idiot, but I did utilize my sources and whatnot. I use outlines as a general guide anyways, I don't typically state my intro, body, and conclusion on them word for word. SafeAssign of course flagged all of the sources on my References page as ""plagiarized,"" so my assignment report is sitting at a ""High Risk"". However, I know that those reports are bogus. The only thing I can do is sit and wait for her to grade it and accept whatever it is.

Regardless, I wish I could just rewind a week and actually put some effort into this assignment. I just feel like an idiot. Procrastinating isn't fun in the long run. I used to not be as much of a procrastinator, I don't know what happened, but now it's something so constant that it might as well be chronic.

If I leave town for college I'll have to live in a dorm and leave my kittens at home, which i really don't want to do since I am their main caretaker and pay for everything. I don't want to burden my mom with them. Plus the colleges outside of my town are more expensive (no scholarships there yet) and living in dorms instead of at home, which I would do if I stayed in town, can be more money added on. I hate my city right now and just want a fresh start but at the same time don't want to leave my kittens and end up spending more on college when i'm trying to keep it cheap.

2023-10-31,1698769469,Failed semester due to insatisfaction,"I failed the semester.

Context is key here. I'm 21. I'm from a small country in which college isn't like in the US.
You go for a class one day. You do homework through online modules. That's it. It's a very distant college experience.

Life has become boring to me. Or rather, insatisfactory. Part of me wishes I could hang out with other people. Interact with others in class. Meet up on weekends and stuff. Just the bare minimum. Anything other than staying in my room playing videogames. I feel myself wasting away. So, driving 30 minutes for a 3 hour class with no social interaction. Or logging in online to do boring homework. It just doesn't sound appealing. And I know not everything in life is fun. But something must be. Back in school, I didn't have this problem. Sure, homework was borderline exvessive and not all classes were interesting. But there was a trade-off. People. People that talk. Classmates to spend time with. To do homework and projects together. 14 year old me would kill me but, I miss group assignments. That was enough for me. Enough for me to put in the effort. It was a good trade-off and my last years of school were challenging, but also beautiful.

 A bit of context here is where I live: People here are not the best at being social. Usually the problem is that one is too introverted. For me, the problem is being too extroverted. People don't like socializing. They get too awkward or defensive if you approach them. So that's kind of what makes this problem. We are very closed people over here and everyone lives inside their own homes all the time or they are party animals that go to discos. There are obviously good traits in everyone, though. But, I'm tired. I've been trying the whole year to look for ""a place"" somewhere where people can be more... open. And I've found out, there isn't in this small city. So I'm changing fields.

I'm moving to a dorm in the US next year. I've always loved it at dorms. Always made friends without problems. I gotta wait until summer since that's when freshman usually enter as adviced by my counsellor. That's too damn long. But anyways. Life moves on. Gotta try again and keep trying.

2023-10-31,1698767570,IT vs Finance for Math/Physics background student in a foreign country,"Hello everyone!

This is my first post on reddit. 

 I am a refugee and was able to enter the American University of Greece. I spent most of my academic life studying technical subjects: physics,mathematics, and programming

  
My university only offers an IT program,and  although it does have a concentration in Software engineering (which is what attracts me most in IT), I feel like CS would suit me best. There are a lot of technical things in IT that are not particularly interesting to me, since I just want to develop software: networks, cyber security aspects, methods of research and so on.

 Combined with the disadvantage of a university program that does not offer CS separately and my budding interests in finance, I often have doubts. I feel that I can excel in both subjects because of my STEM background. 

 My main concern about finance is that it will be very difficult for me to get a job, since I speak English fluently, but I dont speak Greek, so I will need relocation. With programming there are more possibilities in this regard. 

 I have the opportunity to take a major and a minor. What should I do better, start studying two subjects in parallel, and then decide which is better for me?

Even when I grew up and realized being a lawyer was more paperwork than it was actually on the stand, I was still super interested. Cross-analyzing previous cases, studying to present an argument, finding flaws, working with others, being a source of justice (i love watching cases where the obviously wrong side is convicted, something inside of me loves seeing a scumbag go down in court) etc.

But now that I have the opportunity to choose Law as a major, my research has been dull. I'm not the most studious, which means I probably won't have the best shot of getting top 25% in some T10 or T20 school. Then the actual work, 70-80 hours nights, no time to myself, possibly no benefits and a low salary, the absolute mountain of student debts.. it seems awful and i don't want to even give myself the chance of a life like that

I've been very focused on networking, coding, and cybersecurity recently but after 3-4 years of schooling and self teaching i just don't see myself pursuing this as a career.

I was a biology major taking medicine classes. Resulting in me getting a low gpa (2.5). I am now a Kinesiology major. My first semester of junior year I didnt have a great time either (2.6), so I decided to study abroad. That trip helped me build structure and better study habits! That semester I did pretty well, and my summer classes went well. Resulting in my gpa now being a 2.849. I know GPA doesnt matter in the long run, but having one cant help in this economy/job market. 

-Either way, my ultimate goal changed from working with athletes to working in marketing. I was the marketing coordinator and then vice president of the campus wide organization during my freshman and sophomore year. My junior year, I did marketing volunteering at a UK based organization. And as of right now in my senior year, I am a marketing consultant intern at a non profit organization; while also being in affiliation with the marketing club here at college.  On top of that, I was on the track and field team my first two years, also while being apart of a leadership cohort.

TLDR : I have very high expectations for myself, created mental blockade, professor said data looks great and we can look at it together. I started tearing up because I thought he'd be disappointed in me. 



I just went to see my professor about a ""work experience"" class I have to do for my bachelor's. I chose this particular professor because he's very understanding and positive, he's also in the field i see myself working in in the next few years. The assignment was supposed to be for 6 to 8 weeks, however there is no time limit put on when it needs to be graded. It consisted of me gathering data and writing a protocol about it. The protocol part is what gets me really badly. 

I've been in the fields every day collecting data, even when the weather was bad. I wrote the introduction, why the plant is such a good model system for the phenomenon I'm researching, wrote down my hypotheses and started on the discussion based on what I learned from associated papers. However, I'm struggling with explaining my own data. I know it sounds stupid as hell and some of you are probably sitting here, reading this while doing your PhD and thinking ""damn bro you're stupid"", and I get it. I'm trying to make a perfect protocol for something that can never be perfect and there is no perfect and idk what's wrong with me.  

I took my sweet time with it and to be fair, I don't think other professors would have been so lenient with me. I wrote different exams and I went to work, pushing the ""protocol writing part"" further and further back. Now the guild hit me in the throat and I just keep having blockades. Thoughts like ""damn you took a lot of time to write a couple of pages now didn't you?"" And ""lol you do x and y instead of your damn protocol, you lazy cow."" 

I did go and see the professor and showed him my data and he said it's really good repeatedly, but for the life of me I don't know how to make any charts or if any of it it's even important?? Or does it even matter? I'm so scared of putting unimportant data in my protocol and failing, although I damn well know this professor would at least tell me something is wrong before letting me fail. Technically there is no chance of me failing, and even if I do, I can always redo it. So I don't really know what's wrong with me. 

Today I went to see him and I told him that everything is basically written out,however I am stuck at results. He said the data is great and we can just take a look at it together. I expected disappointment but all he showed me was empathy and understanding towards my situation. I started tearing up while he was talking to me about it and I feel really embarrassed about it, especially because there was another professor in the room, however he didn't say anything to me or about it. I'm supposed to defend my thesis to these two professors sometime next year and I feel like I fumbled and acted like a child, but the guild has been eating at my bones for a while now and feeling this release, hearing that all is OKAY and I don't need to worry about it so much felt so good. 

I always try to keep a cool head and keep my composure and resolve as much as I can, so you can imagine how embarrassed I feel right now, although no one judged me, not even a little. I just hope they don't secretly think less of me for stumbling over such a small stone.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17khv0m/teared_up_in_front_of_my_professor_when_talking/

I have a professor in one of my classes who I have also worked under as an RA for about a year, so I see her quite often. Shes very kind, and I like her a lot. 

For some context, I am from Maine and going to school on the other side of the country.

Its been hard to deal with, mainly because Im the only person from Maine anyone here knows and I keep getting asked about the shooting. Constantly. Its exhausting, and its REALLY not helping my mental health. 

Today at the beginning of class (theres only about ten of us students in there), my professor publicly asked how I was doing while reminding the class where I was from, and asked for details about the shooting and how I was dealing with it.

Meanwhile, everyones gawking at me like Im some exotic zoo animal. The entire thing just made me ridiculously uncomfortable. 

I feel like I should bring this up with her, but my question is how should I do that? Shes both the researcher I work under and my professor, and shes an awesome person who I really admire. I dont want to potentially jeopardize anything academically or professionally. So I guess Im asking this:

is me. all this said I have 3 main questions/advice i could use.

1. is there anything at all i can do to lower these costs? ive already begged for more money (they gave me $4k more in aid woohoo), applied to a million scholarships, and have a work study and a part time job.

2.  realistically, will i be able to land a good enough job in my field after school to pay off 160k in debt without completely setting myself up for financial ruin? or should i just go ahead and transfer back to my subpar but still decent state school (UGA)?

3. music is my passion and my real dream is to work in the music/entertainment business. i know it will be much more fulfilling than working in an econ/corporate/government environment, but the pay on average across the music industry field is just sooo much less unless you really make it big or grind up the corporate ladder (for bigger publishing and record label companies). does it make any sense to pursue this career path, or should i just focus in school for a steadier job? i know people be saying pursue your dreams or else youll regret it later in life, but i feel like id also regret having hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt lol.

By the end of my degree, I had went to war with some serious bouts of depression, financial problems, and was perpetually stressed over my GPA. I graduated tired and angry, already having decided the career I earned a degree for was no longer for me. 

Two years later, I entered a highly, highly competitive product design program. I convinced myself that Id be ok. Cs get degrees my professors and advisors said. Your portfolio is what gets you in, not your GPA they said. 

Well, as my first semester comes to an end, I found myself thinking this is a doable amount of controlled chaos, I should probably check to make sure thats the case. So I did, and I found that Bs are what get degrees, not Cs. Ive got strong Cs and low Bs that may not be able to become Bs anymore. 

Now I know shooting for the minimum is my own doing; but damnit I might not be able to get Bs. It felt really nice to not worry about GPA for a while.

Right now, I'm going into my second semester of sophomore year. I'm an accounting major right now. I initially chose accounting because that was the practical choice for me - my father's a CPA, so I have the connections I need, and it has pretty good job security and good pay. I'm pretty smart, as I've consistently gotten good grades throughout high school and even got admitted to an honors program when I applied to the school I'm currently in. I immediately got admitted to the accelerated 5-year master's program for a MAcc as well.

However, I've been reflecting, and I genuinely hate accounting. I hate it. I can't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. It's even evident in my grades, as I haven't been able to manage above a C+ for any accounting class yet. It's not my passion *(I've been gaslighting myself, saying, 'Who* ***really*** *likes* ***accounting****, anyways?' for the last year and a half)*, I don't do well; I'm struggling to understand everything, which causes more stress than anything else in my life. I've spoken to my parents, as they do pay for my college education, and although my mother is somewhat supportive, my father is angry with me for wanting to switch my major. If I choose something practical, he'll still pay for at least some of my education, but I know he will pull out financially at least a little, which I'm prepared for.

My biggest issue now is that I'm stuck on what I really want to do. I don't have any likes/dislikes/hobbies that would fit into a major (I love to crochet, watch TV, etc). I'm a people person for sure, and I want to have a job where I'm not just sitting at a desk all day, staring at numbers and creating balance sheets and income statements. I'm nervous to look at anything outside of business, as then most of my core classes I've taken already wouldn't count. But I don't feel like anything in the business school is for me.

Does anyone have any advice for this situation? I'm already a year and a half in, and I register for new classes on November 10th, which is 9 days from now. I'm terrified.

We wrote in person essays last week and they were descriptive essays. 

He opened class by saying that a lot of essays were lacking in description and many of them had used a lot of the same words/phrases and that its worrying for their futures when writing or expressing themselves in academia.

He asked if anyone ever read Orwells 1984 in the past. I have and apparently I was the only one.(Its a really good book, I recommend it)

He mentioned that a plot point in the story is about the idea of newspeak and what Orwell meant by it in the book. The idea that if a person is limited on the words they know, than they are limited in thought.

He had us read a paragraph from a famous short story afterwards. 

Then he asked us our thoughts on it. Silence, awkward silence because no one wanted to give an answer or couldnt think of one.

Hes a good professor, he clearly likes learning about languages and teaching it but I could feel his dismay at seeing a real version of newspeak occurring in front of him.

I know its probably a mix of anxiety or apathy from students in class but it feels crazy to be literally one of two people in the class willing to answer or give an opinion on something in class and I see it all the time in my classes.

Has anyone else experienced this and how did you recover?,"(20M) As the title suggests, I absolutely bombed my first semester at a local college. I got a late start to college because I wanted to save up and experience different industries before committing to a university. After working full time for a few years I decided I should go to a local CC so I could at least knock my generals out of the way and major in something business related, (business admin, finance, or accounting, etc..)

January 2023, I started studying for the SAT to remove holds on my application, and I took the exam March 11th. I scored a 1200. Not too shabby considering my 3.3GPA in high-school. I registered for my classes as soon as I could and I was set! I was so hopeful and excited for college but in hindsight, I wasn't even remotely prepared. COVID screwed up my last two years of high-school and my attention span/studying skills left much to be desired.

On top of a struggling junior/senior year, I took 5 classes which is exorbitant for a first time student who also works 30+ hours/week. I did cut work days and a class but it didn't seem to matter much. I was so overwhelmed, in some cases for no reason at all. My assignments were turned in, I was showing up to class and yet it was like my brain short-circuited. I couldn't focus or retain a damn thing, I hardly ate or slept for the few short weeks I was in college and my anxiety was crippling. It's completely pathetic, I'm literally a grown ass man who couldn't handle some gen ed classes. 

I dropped all of my classes on census day, closed my computer and cried myself to sleep. The silver lining is my transcripts are fine, no F's or W's. The bad news is I'm still in a depressive rut and have no idea how to go about recovering and preparing for what comes next.

My rent is 250 a month, so a quarter of my monthly paycheck went to rent, and another two quarters was into savings, with the rest left for me to spend freely.

A lot of my savings has gone into my car now. (Free car, spent/spending around 700 to fix it, its almost done). But because Im a new driver (I know, shouldve got my license earlier, but you know), Im expecting a pretty steep rate for car insurance. All the quotes Ive been getting are close to 800 or 900 a month, and that is just absolutely bonkers for me and my pay. 

So, Im looking for a second part time job. Ideally I dont want to work fast food. I cant work a second job on campus, because no matter what we cant have more than a certain amount of hours/week, and my hours would divide between the two so it would be pointless. I work 40 hours per 2 weeks. My class schedule is mid, but my problem is in my after class schedule. Im a theater student, and we have rehearsals until 10pm (for whichever show/semester youre in). Its a pretty demanding schedule, leaving me (maybe) weekends, a single hour between when I get off work in admissions and go to rehearsal, and the hours of 10:30-7:30 AM. Obviously I cant do the last but because I need to sleep. So Im thinking I can only do a weekend job, or, depending on the pay of whatever potential job I get, quit this one and go to the other completely. Its hard trying to find time.

I know this was rambling, but any advice helps loads.

2023-11-01,1698856078,Should freshman year be very easy?,"I dont mean this to be pretentious or anything, I understand that for a variety of reasons it could be easy or difficult depending on the student and their circumstances. The reason Im asking this is because Im worried that Im just not going to learn or be challenged at my school.

For context, I went to my safety school, DePauw, because they offered me a full ride as well as paying for a semester abroad, pretty good deal compared to paying 20-30k a year at UMich. However, the classes Im taking are just not challenging, its just a lot of busy work. In econ Im learning the same things I did in HS, in French the 300 level course is way below my level because the next hardest course I could take is the capstone course which Im not allowed to take (I have to take 3 more French courses in order to get to that and do a minor, so it basically just means slogging through lower level courses that wont help me at all). What Id like to do with French is get it out of the way so I can learn a different language, as I can already speak decent French so its more so about having a piece of paper that says I can do it. In my first year seminar we read and then go to class and discuss, then write an essay every few weeks, same thing for my history course. even though its about a topic Im interested in, this just isnt helping me, doesnt help that a lot of the other students dont care and never participate in class.

Unfortunately I feel like Ive found a cool group of friends, Im in a theatre production, and Ive started hitting the gym to fill my time. Im generally getting into a really good rhythm for myself, but its just the classes themselves that arent useful and wont probably be useful for a while. l Id like to learn a new language, do math, new econ, or environmental science because I wasnt able to do these things in hs but its feeling like college so far has just been a lot of busy work and tiptoeing through bullshit requirements.

2023-11-01,1698843003,Kind of Regretting My Hospitality Management Course and Considering Marketing,"Hello, I'm a second-year college student currently enrolled in a Hospitality Management course. Now, let me explain why I chose this course. In high school, my parents, especially my father, wants me to pursue a career related to the cruise ship industry. Many of my relatives from both sides of the family work in the cruise ship industry, that's why my father believed it was a best path. He made it clear that the decision was still up to me, but he just really felt that the cruise ship industry was an best choice. Additionally, ny parents also suggested other courses like Accounting or related to Technology, such as IT, Computer Science, and more.

As I entered college, I settled on Hospitality Management. My decision was influenced by my father's preference. Well I also think Hospitality Management is really a good course because it has a wide range career opportunities. I also want to have a business in the future, like restaurant, resort, or any other related to Hospitality Management that's why I chose this course.

However, after a year has passed now that I'm second year, I've started to have some regrets. I find Hospitality Management as a boring course (sorry huhu), and I'm not good at cooking or whatsover (well I'm practcing cooking now) that's why I get tired of it and I don't find this course as enjoyable. 

As I search to internet, I've discovered that Marketing is incredibly engaging and enjoyable, especially when I read about the experiences of people working in that field on social media/internet. They enjoying the creative process of crafting compelling messages, designing eye-catching visuals, developing strategies to engage with audiences, analyzing market trends, managing social media communities, and more! This is precisely what I aspire to do. I understand that Marketing is also hard and challenging, but when I compare it to the two courses I mentioned, I find Marketing much more appealing. 

At this point, I'm unsure about what to do. I'm hesitant to switch courses because it would mean potentially wasting the two years I've invested in Hospitality Management. I'm at a crossroads, and I'm seeking advice on how to navigate this situation:(((((",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17lbdjd/kind_of_regretting_my_hospitality_management/

I didn't plan on living for this long, so now I have no idea what to do moving forward. Even as a kid I didn't have any ""dream job"", I just wanted to think about the present.

I'm doubting myself like crazy. Do I even have any passions or hobbies? Does it matter if I like the major or not? Should I just focus on what makes the most money? Would it make my parents proud? Is it worth it? Why am I paying for classes that I don't even need? What am I doing with my life? 

I think I gotta eat properly or something of the sort because my mind is spiraling and I can't think straight.

My mom begged me after I graduated from high school to get enrolled in college immediately or my dad will want to kick me out of the house. Of course, I did so. My dad has disowned me beyond comprehension so far and he can barely interact with me as if I'm some unfortunate pitiful stranger. I wanna prove everyone wrong, that I am very much capable of taking care of myself and living as an adult.

Thing is... I have literally no knowledge of college/university or what even lies ahead. I'm just blindly taking courses and crying myself to sleep with how much homework I have. I don't even know where this homework will actually take me, I'm just doing it because that's all I know.

In spring, student disability service counselor at my college. First time talking to a college staff member face to face. Asked me if I plan on just going for general ed or if I'm planning on transferring to a state University or some big name universities. You could imagine my reaction, I was like what do those terms even mean? (She was using acronyms) Now second semester, currently mid way into the fall, I'm still clueless as to what all this college terminology is and why is there different types of schools like trade school or med school that I wasn't aware of?

Met up with academic counselor at 8am sharp because making appointments with them are hard to get because of the amount of slots taken. Talked to a guy and I straight up told him I literally don't know what I'm doing I'm just upset I'm paying $400 for classes I haven't taken yet. He said he'll change my major to liberal arts until I figure it out with a career counselor. Then with a career counselor over the phone(I was on my lunch break at work) she asks if I've taken any career assessments online before? the day before our appointment I was doing like 20 different tests with some confusing and frustrating results. She says okay well for now we'll talk again another time and it's been a full month or two since then.

I feel like this sub may get these posts often where someone's like: any major and career recommendations for a guy that likes science and hates math? So I won't particularly mention what I'm passionate about and what my values are unless prompted, but do know that I'm extremely picky.

Note: A lot of things are missing in this due to my fear of revealing where I live in the US and I literally cannot recall much more.

He worked for several years before going to college which is why he's so much older. Sometimes he can be a bit abrasive or annoying, but I don't think he's a weird guy. But the fact that he's so much older than me adds to my confusion about how to take this comment.

We're both in this club that has weekly social events in addition to the typical club meetings. Today, at the social event, there were about 6 people and we were playing a game where you have to name things in categories. I had to name a 'cause of death' and I said asphyxiation. A few people probably laughed or said that was so specific, idk it's just my go-to whenever I play. But he said 'well, I guess we know what OP does when his roommate isn't home'. I'm not sure if anyone else heard it because it wasn't silent or anything in the room. I just laughed in the moment but looking back I feel a little weird.

It sounds pretty clearly to me like a sexual innuendo referring to autoerotic asphyxiation. And the fact that he's so much older than me, not someone my age, gives it a different feeling. But maybe he meant that when my roommate isn't home, I kill people? That would be pretty clearly a joke and I wouldn't have a problem. Or maybe it has a different meaning entirely that I can't think of, and I'm just being sensitive. What do you guys think it meant?

Recently I have decided that I am going to do a leave of absence during the spring semester and just get some credits at a college that is about 20 mins from my home.   After that I'm going to either transfer to the college close to home or return to my current college if not accepted.

I have only really made one friend besides my roommate and I just get really homesick whenever I think about home. My mom and I are super close and she is fully supportive of my decision to do a LoA and/or transfer. But I'm worried now that I may have made a wrong choice.

2023-11-02,1698967418,Need Advice,"I'm an ecology major taking a class that counts as a writing requirement towards graduation. The content is completely unrelated to what I am interested in but I have to fill the requirement and this class was all that was offered at the time. 

College in general is something I am really only doing because it is expected of me to do so. Having a degree where I live by default makes you more employable simply by demonstrating you know how to jump through hoops. As a student I am more interested in passing rather than genuinely engaging with the content whether it applies to me or not. Essentially, I've figured out how to do well without having to try all that hard. Outside of school when it comes to work, volunteering, and real life experience in my field of interest, I am much more engaged and try to focus my time on things that I deem valuable and often excel as a result. 

Anyway, for this class we are required to design and conduct an experiment to then present to the class. This has been given to us as a homework assignment and we are not given any class time to work on it. Currently I am working full time and taking four other classes on top of this class (two are asynchronous). Experimental design is also not something I plan on focusing on in the future. I am more interested in community based agriculture and sustainability with a hope of working at a non profit. Hardcore research based around the evolution of species and lab work is not on my radar, but is essentially what we are being asked to do. Prior to registering I was not aware that this would be a requirement for this class. 

My professor (the first time any professor has ever commented on my actions) has reached out to admonish my leaving early and lack of a solid idea for my project. And this is where I need help. I have one semester left before I graduate and can likely retake this requirement next semester with a different subject. Outright failing is not ideal, but it won't interrupt my graduating and will mildly affect my overall gpa of 3.5, but I recognize that my behavior and outlook on school won't mesh well with a one on one encounter with my professor (who themselves is incredibly passionate about the topic) and it is better to just pass without having to retake. 

How do I convey that I am ok with doing a bad job without unintentionally dissing my profs whole profession? 

My idea isn't amazing but I figure if I move ahead with the idea and create a realistically bad project but complete the assignment that it won't be the worst thing. But this prof is now singling me out and in my opinion cares a little too much. Even so, if I get a 50 out of 100 on the project I would still pass the class, but it is also possible that I get a zero if I don't do what the prof wants. 

Should I just get over myself and do what the prof wants or be honest and take the risk of failing? If I do, it would require spending close to a 100-150$ on materials which is money I don't have as my living expenses are very high due to where I live. I can only be reimbursed afterwards with no option for getting the funds up front which puts me in a bind financially. 

I do tend to get in my own way when it comes to direct confrontation and have yet to learn how to bite my tongue when asked to be honest about something when it may be better to just tell them what they want to hear. ",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17mgx90/need_advice/
2023-11-02,1698966640,Withdrawing from College: Am I Crazy?,"As I said in another post, my life has been a mess past these two years. My Mother passed away unexpedectly in December 2021. Afterwards, it was just me and my Father. He took it hard and got engaged to his girlfriend short after my Mom's death. He also kicked me out in our new home and I had to fly back to my home state on the day before Christmas Eve to live with my friend and her family for a couple of months and finish community college.

Shortly after I graduated, my Father didn't want to take me back in and I lived with my Mom's side of the family. The problem is, while the area they live in is nice, ***there is NOTHING there.*** They live up in the mountains and in a different state, but there are very little jobs available. You also can't get around there if you do not have a car. There is also no public transportation and I am physically disabled so I can't walk there alone without any assistance.

I was going to college in my home state majoring in Accounting, but I knew that I didn't want to do Accounting and just wanted it for the ""stability"". But I decided I did not want to wait two years to live independently and decided I cannot go back to my Mom's side of the family's state when I graduate college to live with them.

Instead, I'm currently working as a subsitute teacher with the special needs kids and I found a very good shared room in a town with way more resources and public transportation. I'm also trying to find a part-time evening job and planning to do a quick certificate at a local community college in phblotomy. In the Spring, I plan to do school online and therefore, I withdrew from the semester as I know for a fact that my credits won't transfer. But I do know I have to pay the loans back until after I graduate.

Now, I did this without talking to my family at all, but I realized I needed to do it now rather than later. Because I did not want to sit there a few years after I graduate doing nothing and for them to drive me back and forth when I find new places and/or job interviews. As I said before, I also don't want to do Accounting (or any other business/marketing office job)

In the first class a random girl sat next to me. She was attractive and I decided that I was going to talk to her. The professor is a bit strict because he doesnt let us talk with each other, so I thought the best way to approach her is right after the class. But that girl was writing too many notes. When the class ended she was still writing. I tried to be as slow as I could while I was putting my notebook, my pen and other items in my backpack but she was still writing. So I decided that I couldnt wait more because it would become kinda awkward and I left the class. 

In the second class I saw the only girl from college that I am 100% attracted to. She was sitting next to one of her friends. I decided not to sit close to her as I wasnt sure if I was going to make a move (today I am kinda sick and I was feeling a bit exhausted at that time+ low confidence because of what happened previously). After I warmed up and regained my confidence by metting some new guys during the break, when I returned to the class I noticed that she was alone because her friend had left. I said to myself that this is a golden opportunity and I must approach her after the class. I was super determined to do it. I knew exactly how to approach her and I was hoping for the best. But when the class ended she made a phone call and she left talking to the phone. So it was impossible for me to make a move.

2023-11-02,1698957393,Falling out with roommate...,"So for the past 2 months my relationship with my roommate had been mostly fine.  We're very different people but managed to get by without any disagreements.  However, one major issue that has affected me severely is the light.  She likes to leave her LED lights on, her PC on, etc, literally 24/7.  It will be nighttime and we'll both be sleeping but it feels like day time.  I've had to get a literal tent to cover myself in my dorm from the light, but that doesn't do anything.  I'm in the process of getting a single, so i've mostly been able to hold out, but recent events + insomnia that I've developed have made things quite difficult.

Two nights ago, she came back to the dorm at 2:30 in the morning, and turned the overhead light on, making the entire room extremely bright.  At the time I was asleep but got woken up.  I got kind of upset, and snapped, saying: ""hey maybe we could turn the light off given that it's 2:30 in the f\*\*\*ing morning?""  She didn't respond and turned the lights off a few minutes later, and didn't mention it.  Last night she was gone all night, but left her LEDs and PC on again, as well as her fan.  The next morning, I texted her asking that if she's not in the room to please keep the lights and fan off, and that I have a sleep disorder which is made worse by the light.

Several hours later I received an extremely angry and somewhat threatening text from her.  She told me that I should just switch rooms, because she likes to have the light on, and nothing I can say will make her change what she's doing.  She also went after me and started attacking me for a mess on my side of the room (it's not affecting her in any way nor is it unsanitary, just a clump of clothes).  She also then brought up me kinda snapping at her and told me to ""watch your mouth when you talk to me"".  Essentially, she's unwilling to do anything to compromise whateosever.  She basically treats the room as if it's her own.  I was quite upset at this point and we argued for a bit before I said that I was trying to get off campus housing.  She then seemed to apologize, saying that she ""doesn't want me to get insomnia"" but that we're just incompatible as roommates.  I should also point out that she didn't promise to do anything about the light or whatever.

I've talked to my parents and I'm meeting with the housing department tomorrow to try and get a room change or a single very soon, but that might take a few days and so there's going to be some awkwardness when I come back tonight.

I'm posting here because I am stuck and can't decide what to do about my major. I am a late sophomore/early junior (technically a senior hours wise) computer engineering major who has been slowly realizing my love for math throughout university. I believe I like applied math more than pure though so if I did the double major it would be in applied specifically.   


This new found interest is causing problems . I really find computer engineering interesting especially embedded systems and the job outlook is another added bonus. I will be graduating 3 semesters late if I choose the computer engineering degree. If I chose a computer science degree I would graduate 2 semesters late. If I did a Computer Science + Math double major I would graduate 4 semesters late.   


I feel like I might want to pursue higher education in math or a math heavy field in ECE or CS in the future, but I don't believe a graduate degree in math would be possible without a lot of extra math classes or a whole double major. So that leaves me with 2 options. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cram as many math classes as I can into my Computer Engineering degree as possible and hope that might be enough to allow me to get into a masters program somewhere.
2. switch to a computer science + math double major and graduate later (Which I have no scholarships for) but with the guarantee that if I wanted to I would have the classes required for a grad degree in math.

(Also I personally don't live at home I live at a relative's house but whatever I'm just calling it home for the ease and simplicity of it.) 

Studying at home:

\-Very quiet when no one is at home, but when people are home very loud

\-People still come up and talk to you/interrupt you because you're at home

\-Not as aesthetically pleasing

\-You don't have to drive lol

\-Easier to take a break

\-You can study/do homework there 24/7

Studying at the library:

\-A controlled amount of quiet. Not as quiet as when nobody is at home, but not as loud as when people are home

\-Pretty much nobody talks to you

\-More aesthetically pleasing

\-You have to drive

\-Not \*as\* easy to take a break because you have to take your stuff with you (or at least I do) if you want to walk around/read a book/get coffee or something

\-Closes at 4-6 PM depending on which one in the area I personally live in

2023-11-02,1698951960,Dropped out of 4 different colleges - is there no hope left for me?,"So here is the timeline of my educational disaster:

2016: I graduated high-school after having a terrible time mentally/socially. I only applied for one local school but due to burn out/lack of motivation/lack of discipline I dropped out but I never formally left the school which resulted in Fs across the board for my first semester. The school was local as well and my home life at the time was not good. To be honest I was pressured by my parents to go to college but I just was not ready at the time.

2017: I had been working retail consistently while not going to school - but issues with my mother reached a boiling point and my dad decided it would be a good idea for me to go away to college to get some space. I ended up thriving there for a semester and got good grades and I was hopeful. The space away from my mom really helped. However upon starting my second semester my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. This destroyed me because my father was my best friend and we did everything together. Without a second thought I came back to my home to help with his illness.

2018: I was home and my dad kept getting worse - Im not going to get into how intense brain cancer is - but lets just say when they initially operated on his tumor - I lost my father on the operating table. He stayed on hospice care in our home and I wanted to make him happy. All he wanted was for me to go to college it was his dream. I decided to apply for a local community college. I wish I never made this choice because my mental state was not good. I barely attended class due to my dad being in and out of the hospital and ultimately being on hospice care. Once again this resulted in F grades due to lack of attendance.

2019: At this point my father had passed away. My whole family had to move and I was so lost. I wanted to make my dad up in heaven proud and I actually got a scholarship to a music program at a great college despite my bad grades. I thought this was my chance to finally complete school but then I found out the pandemic hit. All my music courses would be online.

Im on antibiotics, steroids, pain meds and no one who will permanently solve the problem that seems to be that I need up to 3 teeth pulled.

I recently learned that I have to take an extra semester to finish school because one of the last courses I have to take is so hard it literally takes up 40 hours a week. Studying for this shit all the time is so exhausting.

I try to make time for myself to eat healthy, go to the gym, go to parties, but I still feel kinda miserable.

My dating life has also been miserable. Consistently tried to ask girls out irl and on dating apps and even spent $100+ on dating apps subs but I've gotten almost nothing out of it. Still never have been in a meaningful relationship of any kind. Hell, even the girls on Tinder are just alcoholics in sororities. The only girl who I even kissed and even got close with ended up rejecting me because I'm a virgin.

Now that we moved to the US I am afraid it will be impossible for me to get a job unless I complete my studies, but here's the pickle: We don't know when we will be required to return to our home country as my husband's work visa is attached to the company he's currently working at.

2023-11-02,1698939682,I hate my major,"For reference, I am a sophomore in college, and my freshman year I switched from engineering to business. I was so excited for engineering and I absolutely loved it. The only reason I changed was due to my crazy first semester schedule including bio, chem, calculus, and history (I suck at history), and as a gifted kid in high school, I didnt know how to study and I ended up having to drop calculus and chemistry. My dad recommended I change majors, and so I did. 

I am now a business major and I absolutely hate it. Its not too hard, but I am so uninterested that I cannot force myself to pay attention. Whats also discouraging is I went to a STEM career fair and adored it but when I went to the business fair I didnt see anything that remotely interested me. 

I want to switch majors, but I dont know what to. I have no life plans and no career goals. I currently work in a bank and already know I dont want to do that for the rest of my life. I dont want to work a desk job, but with business it looks like thats what Im going to be doing. I havent picked a business sector to declare, but school is so draining to me because I know this isnt what I want to do, but I only have scholarships for 4 years of school, and switching now seems like a great way to lose money and stay in school longer. 

I really want to do data science, but at the college I go to, you have to pay for both the engineering and business schools, and that seems so extra. Engineering was going to be a way to get me to do data analysis, but business could do the same. I also like accounting, but I dont want to do a desk job.

I believe Im good at math, but calculus was awful, and Im taking an online statistic like class right now and not doing well (which I blame the teacher and my lack of interest for). I dont want to be in school forever, so med and law school are out of the picture.  

Should I switch majors? If so what to? Are there any non desk jobs that business majors can receive? Should I just suck it up and finish since I have two years?

(I also put this in r/advice and r/teenagers LOL I genuinely dont know what to do)

(this also happened yesterday, but its still on my mind)

I (18F) am the eldest daughter to two immigrants, living in California (so this is why Im asking for advice LOL) and I go to community college. 

For context, I just got hired to work at a daycare, and upon hire, they ask that you go get a basic physical checkup and provide results. The clinic I was assigned to go to has a very limited number of physicals they take on the daily, so I have to get up really early tomorrow if I want to make it before my deadline.

The issue is, Im in charge of taking care of my little sister (9F) and have to take her to school every morning. That includes getting her ready, feeding her breakfast, and driving her to school. But I fell behind and am only able to get up early enough to drive her to school. My father does the first half. Honestly, this is on me because I spend a lot of time during the night talking to my friends online instead of getting sleep to wake up early. 

So my mom and I planned what were going to do tomorrow: I take my little sister with me to the clinic and feed her breakfast, then just drop her off late.

When we told my father our plans at dinner, he got VERY angry.

When I left the house to go to rehearsal for the show Im in (I also do theatre), my mom called me and told me about how she and my dad had an argument about it and he started talking about how HES never included in my mom and Is plans, how HE always gets up early to feed and clothe my sister and how IM not doing my share of work.

This isnt new to me. When my fathers angry he will say the most insulting things ever, especially when its about me.

Im just so confused. When he asks me to focus on my studies, I do. He says do whatever you want, as long as you have an A. But it absolutely does not feel like that at all.

After two years of community college, I initially planned to transfer to San Francisco State University. But I absolutely cannot take this anymore.

This is the part where I need advice. My dad is very careful about finances, and hes always made saving money a big point for me ever since I was young. I want to transfer to SFSU as soon as possible. But if I move out now, I just know Ill feel such a big guilt and selfishness over leaving my family. Or feel as if Im leaving a financial dent because of tuition fees. My father doesnt say this, but my mother does all the time. They need me. Especially for my sister, whom I am also very close with. And when Im not there, what happens?

What do I do? Should I move out for my sake? Or do I stay longer for them?

TL;DR: I am the eldest daughter of immigrants and my father makes me feel worthless. But if I move out Ill feel guilty because of finances and because of my sister.

For the sake of privacy i wont list specific courses but there is a psychology class which i am leaving out of the next description bc im more focused on bio/chem.

-2 sciences spring
- 1 summer (seems like an easier bio course, but this would mean accelerated, so 8-10 weeks rather than 16)
- 3 fall (2 bios here which is what im hesitant about)

I dont think im allowed to list specific courses here but i will say the 2 bios in fall are very different biology courses. Not rly related to one another so i dont see any overlap happening there. 

I think maybe a wiser choice may be to get rid of the summer class and do 3 courses spring, 3 fall, then 3 spring 2025 it j sucks that it would push back university transfer to fall of 2025.

2023-11-02,1698933028,Missed my midterm due to a panic attack,"I kind of saw it coming though. I havent been able to open a textbook for the past few days, even though I spent the entire week before at the library studying from morning to noon. I knew this last test was coming up, and the more I thought about studying, the more anxious I got. I ended up being okay with the theory but didnt practice any of the exercises available. I woke up early, completely shut down, and drove to school. As I got closer, it became harder to breathe, and the air felt so hot, even though its 28ºF outside. I parked, walked heavily on campus, but then ran into the closest bathroom and completely fell apart. I was on the ground, crying, unable to control my emotional state for 30 minutes straight.

Afterward, I tried to pull myself together, found an empty classroom, and told myself I had to study some more or really just do anything else, but I started breaking down again. Shaking, barely strong enough to even cry out loud, then passed out to wake up feeling even weaker and so tired. I called my clinic and asked for an appointment so I could get provided with a medical certificate to support my absence. My chest is burning, I have plans with a friend, and I want to disappear because I dont want to cause trouble or explain whats going on. This kind of thing hasnt happened to me in years.

2023-11-02,1698932994,Dropped out and restarted several times. Can anyone relate?,"Hello everyone. I (23F) have been at college for quite a while now, and have been through several programs now. Here is a rough timeline:

* 2018 - 2019: Bachelor's English teaching. Did this for 1,5 years before deciding teaching ultimately wasn't for me.
* 2020: Bachelor's Pedagogy. Did this for a couple months because I had no idea what else to do. Got absolutely fed up with it after a few months.
* 2021 - 2023: Bachelor's Animal Management. Absolutely loved this, but had to drop out due to long-term illness in my second year.
* 2023 - now: Associate's Animal Management. Basically the two-year version of the bachelor's, but the level is much lower.

As you can gather, the bachelor's Animal Management was something I really loved doing. When I had to drop out, I chose to settle for the associate's version. That's something I really, really regret. This program is way too easy and doesn't really offer anything substantial compared to the bachelor's. I'm having quite a hard time adjusting to the much lower level and I'm thinking of switching back to a bachelor's again, likely Applied Biology. I then hope to be able to graduate some time at age 27 or 28.

Could anyone possibly relate to my situation? I don't think I've ever met someone who's switched courses as much as I have. It makes me feel pretty alone, since my peers have already graduated years ago and my classmates are only getting younger and younger. It feels pretty isolating.",college,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17m3wn8/dropped_out_and_restarted_several_times_can/

2023-11-04,1699095573,How to handle a roommate who appareantly hates me for seemingly no reason?,"It's been one and a half month since i've moved into a 3 person dorm room. They are both older than me and are former friends, enrolled in same year and are pretty close. In the first two weeks or so I tried to have conversations with them, knock on the door and say hi whenever i entered the room and stuff, basically things we would do with my former roommates. But i quickly realised even if they responded to me, they couldn't be bothered to do any of these and didn't seem to care when i did so i stopped as well. 

Even though i basically don't interact with either of them and can't study in the room because of the noise they make when they are both in the room and spend most of my time outside/library, especially one of them seem to can't stand me whenever i am present in the room? 

she keeps saying she cant sleep (not to me, to the other girl), she scuffs and pushes the blanket over the top of her head when im getting ready for an 8 am lecture (i only turn on my desk lamp and am walking on eggshells to not make noise). Meanwhile i wake up to her slamming the doors when she is the one who has a lecture early in the morning. She also asked me to turn off my desk lamp and study in the caffeteria the one night i didnt go to library (i was sick) because she had an exam tomorrow, and i had too. And guess what, i turned off MY fucking desk lamp and went downstairs.

The final straw that made me type out all of this was how terribly sick i was feeling yesterday evening when i got out of a lecture basically beaten up at 7 pm, found them both in a dark room one of them sleeping, the other one looking at her phone in bed and thought i could also get some sleep. They both ocasionally sleep daytime and i try to not make any noise and don't even turn on my desk lamp unless it is pitch dark. I sometimes just leave them alone and take myself out if i can. Yesterday was THE only day I went to bed early only for once and the very minute i put my head on the pillow after taking painkillers, one of them asked to turn on the blinding white leds at the ceiling, they both got up and started chit chatting real loud at the top of my bed. 

I was on the verge of tears trying to sleep under thw blanket until i finally asked that girl as sweetly as i could 'cant you just use your desk lamp or something?' she looked funnily at her friend one moment but then said fine without looking at me and got out of the room slamming the door on her way out before her friend finished the sentence ""are you seriously going out?"". i have never lived with people who showed so little sympathy towards me i felt horrible and pretended to sleep.

I dont think i can change my room anytime soon, the dorms in my uni are basically crammed and im really lucky to have found this room but this girl is driving me nuts. i feel so unwelcomed in my own room. do i try to talk to them about this and fail miserably or do i act like a bitch, how to deal with this?",college,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17nj8gd/how_to_handle_a_roommate_who_appareantly_hates_me/

2023-11-04,1699078350,Advice for my university decision,"So I have been reading alot on different careers and I finally decided to study AI and I will study AI in UAE. Now here is the main problem, I have 2 options and I want your opinion on it.

First option, is to study AI in the british university in dubai (BUID).

Price: 47650 AED with communication from abu dhabi to dubai

Advantages: I get to study what I love, which is AI and in a british university. This program is recognized by QAA

Disadvantages: price is too high, I have to go by a private bus everysingle day from abu dhabi to dubai, which will be around 3 hours and a half everyday.

Second option, is to study software engineering, ( which is getting less popular because of AI taking over 80% of its job) in 
AL AIN university.

Price: 32k without communication, cuz my dad can drop me off on his way to work, which is much much cheaper, in 4 years I will have saved around 62k AED if am comparing it to dubai one.

Advantages, its only 30 min away from my home, not an hour 45 min like dubai ( meaning am not wasting as much time of my day so I can go get a part time job to help with the finances). Price is way cheaper. This program is recognized by ABET.

Disadvantages : am not studying exactly what I want and am afraid AI will take over software engineering, I will be studying biology, chemistry, physics 1, physics 2 and laboratory physics which are the 3 most hated subjects for me. 

If I take option 1 then I really don't know how my dad will be able to finance my study, I know for a fact that he cannot do that, so it will probably be debt for me later, which I really don't want, especially that nowadays people are having a really hard time finding a job in the uae, so Imagine a new student without experience.

If I take option 2, I will have the possibility to get a part time job which will pay 37k AED a year thats if I work 4 hours for 5 days a week, which will help alot with the finance, because that will mean that my dad won't have to pay for my university tuition, am thinking like that because I have a little brother 4 years younger than me, so the moment I finish college he will have to pay for my brother as well, so that will be hard if not impossible. Plus I will have to study many subjects I hate so much. What I plan to do if I take this option, is finish my degree with 0 debt cuz of my part time, and go study masters somewhere in europe, USA, Australia, somewhere like that, to get a strong master degree, while studying I will get a job just so I get the experience for when I finish ny masters and then come back here to work, and nobody can ask for 2 years of experience because I should already have them.

So which option do you guys think I should take, obviously am leaning to option number 2, just cuz financial stuff, I know for a fact my dad can't finance my full tution for 4 years, so how about my brothers, so the part time job am looking is really helpful. ( He makes around 8k AED + he gets free rent )

Ok am done, that was honestly tiring, if somebody actually read all that then I will be amazed, and thank you for reading all that, leave a comment on what you suggest, it doesn't have to be a professional opinion or anything like that, anything will help.

I would most likely not be able to have an internship or otherwise if I were to stay in the area. Another thing is that I would have to room with a lot of people, (ie: renting a bedroom off campus). Although I am open to that, I dont know how that would go. 
Option #2. I could possibly transfer to my partners university for the upcoming fall semester and live with them. The major I am looking at is a child and family development bachelors. I read that the degree can be a little bit difficult to find a job in, but it can be implemented with some jobs/experience to lessen that difficulty. Most of my credits would transfer seamlessly, I would do the same route as stated previously and get a license or certificate for a concentration after graduation. The school is within walking distance to a lot of opportunities when it comes to internships, as it is more urban. Some cons would include a more expensive rent (only by $50), I would have to switch some of my classes around to satisfy this schools prerequisites, and it would be a bit of a hassle to get all of the transfer stuff figured out. 
Either way, my partner says that they just want me to be happy, and choose the best decision for myself.

This is somewhat of an update to the post I made the other day about feeling like an idiot. It ties to that assignment, but this was an interesting turn of events.

The outline to the debate was ""graded"" today, a solid 0/0, but the comment the instructor left was interesting. She said my outline looks great, but she says that she understands if I would likely want to write a paper rather than complete a video debate like what was originally supposed to happen, and that if that is the case, I should let her know so she could update the rubric for me. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm a terrible speaker, especially at debates. The person I am when I speak and the person I am when I write are two very different people. This instructor knows how I write and had recommended that I looked into a research Master's program. So being offered with this opportunity to instead turn in a paper rather than record myself doing the debate is one that is interesting to me. Not only that, but I'm nervous recording myself as last time I attempted to record myself for the last debate, I ended up installing a fake Zoom app on my laptop that came with adware from PCAppstore, so I somewhat have anxiety with dealing with any sort of recording software.

However, on the other hand, I feel as though this is unfair to my classmates who likely aren't given this same opportunity. It's the only reason I'm hesitant to immediately email her that I'd rather do the paper. So, I guess my main question is if I should write the paper or stick with recording myself with the debate? If you were given this opportunity, would you take it?

And I knew that I loved anatomy and whatnot. So I enlisted in the army for 6 years as a medic and did that with the benefit of **almost** free college. I also worked in a hospital drawing blood and stuff and have a very good side hustle working with antique human skeletons (essentially museum conservation). I have now been working on a biology degree with the original intent on going to med school.

Now Ill get into why I feel like college is a waste, I have taken soo many classes, and its just like highschool. You take a class that has nothing to do with what youll do in a career and throw everything away that you learned once the semester is over. You do the real learning on the job, I worked with nurses that didnt remember anything important from college, I have had to teach them things in the hospital (I dont have a degree Im just a nobody). I swear I have met so many people with degrees that dont know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system 80% or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than 80% and youd get a 0%. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all. I have learned so much outside of college and have made wayyy more connections outside of college, I have grown wayyy more without college. I believe I can be successful without having a degree, seems like a waste of time.

Im just going to add that nobody in my family has a degree but some of my family members currently work on college boards. Funny huh no degree and making decisions for the college. Colleges are just a business trying to take as much money as they can.

Math has always been my strong suit but this college algebra class has been HELL. Not because the concepts are hard for me to understand or implement, but because the professor is the worst communicator Ive ever worked with. None of my other professors blindly assign work and offer little resources or help for us. 

Regularly, MyMathLab will have questions thats arent taught in our resource material for our weekly homework. For instance well be learning about finding the zeros of polynomial functions for 3 term equations, and one off the wall question was on the homework about interpreting the graph to find the zeros of a 5 term polynomial using the quadratic formula. When I email her, at least 4 times this semester she said oh dont worry about that, I didnt know it was on there, Ill give credit to everyone OR I cant email an explanation, schedule a zoom call for more help. Then this kind of problem is never on a quiz or test. 

Recently, shes assigned us a quiz covering concepts from lessons/homework for the FOLLOWING week. She said in a D2L email the day that the quiz was due that its been brought to my attention yada yada, Ill be extending the quiz deadline to the day before next weeks homework is due. 

Yesterday she gave us a module 4 test, that are explicitly meant to be over the modules they pertain to, and not collective. The very first question on this test was an advanced concept from module 1. The tests are all proctored on Lockdown browser and we get one page of notes, and a very limited amount of time for each test. I got 100% of module 4s questions right except for the one from module 1 because I wasnt prepared for it. 

I emailed her, professionally pleading for an answer as to why, again, communication wasnt clear on important assignments. This was the only test this semester that wasnt exclusively over its respective module. None of my other professors would do something like this.

2023-11-03,1699038137,"Should I take my last five classes in one semester to finished my prerequisite on time, or spread it into two semester but be held back one more year?","I really need advice on this matter. I apologized if this is the wrong post to post too. I been in college for two years now. Spring 2024 was supposed to be my last semester before I can apply to the Dental Hygiene program in PBSC. Unfortunately, I had to withdraw College Algebra due to the professor having a high fail rate. Putting me in the positions of 5 courses for Spring semester instead of 4. The remaining prerequisite I need to finish before applying to the program is Anatomy &amp; Physiology 2 both lecture and lab, Microbiology both lecture and lab, and now College Algebra.

I can handle four courses with a few tears here and there, but I'm not so sure with an additional course. My brother doesn't think I should take all five considering how intensive they are. But if I don't take all five and just spread them out into two semester. I won't be able to apply for the program since the deadline is June 1st. I would have to wait for another year to apply and even that isn't really a guaranteed that I'll be accepted into the program.

For additional information. I don't work. I live with my parents rent free. My father is paying for my complete education but only up to 5 years before he retires from his job. He wants me to have an education before spreading my wings and move out. I wanted to graduate at age 28, but being held back for one year might push me to graduate at age 30 instead. I just turn 25 and I feel like time is running out. I guess I feel ashamed that I'm graduating in my late twenties.

Should I just suck it up and do the five courses for spring 2024? OR take my time and spread them into two semester w/ guarantee good grades? Any advice will help. I am sorry for the long post and grammar.

2023-11-03,1699036576,Has your entire department having negative views about you ever make you reconsider your entire life?,"Title. 
I had some blunders involving a lot of personal matters (nothing illegal. More mental health oriented). It's gotten to the point I had law enforcement enter my dorm room because no one had heard from me in a while. Since then I think my relationships with college faculty and department heads soured since talking to other departments doesn't have the same awkwardness. 

There were also some stuff involving a competition I had to bail out of last minute due to exams not being negotiable to move (occured on the same date, tried telling professors in advance), and the department head for a different option (same field though) doesn't talk to me anymore. Also previously worked with another person who IS the head of the current specialization I'm in who doesn't have stellar opinions about me due to mental health issues affecting my experience at this position.

It doesn't affect me sometimes, but I landed a really great position at a non university place. When I had to ask for references, only 2 out of the four people responded, and they were either just prior friends or a random colleague from a non-major position I held. I had to get another person to just submit a reference anyways just for HR reasons and apparently they did not give me a great review (was told it seemed personal, I don't really recall having any negative interactions with this person/asked them to be a reference and they said yes?). 

Anyways since that happened it makes me think about hopping ships to a different major (I'm currently junior standing, so not a great time to do it) exclusively because I feel like I'm being treated differentially, especially academically and professionally. I genuinely love the current path I'm on, it just feels like shit having to interact with these people when I'm dependent on them for a successful future.

I don't like disclosing everything that happens in my personal life (had a lot happen in the past 3 years), but as far as they know I'm just highly mentally volatile (I have been getting major help, I just don't live in the U.S., so familial support is super limited and I think that contributes to a lot of the stress). For every negative trait I know I've been described I had like 5 other people vouch that isn't true (for example, reliability). Sorry I'm being vague its mostly for privacy, but I can disclose stuff if people really need to?

And maybe i do have anxiety but theres a million ways to do wrong and almost looks like one way to do things correctly.

And i only ask questions when its the Professor's own hand picked hand made course (in contrast to Macmillian Pearson courses i mean)

Because i feel like i wouldnt ask so many questions if one, they didnt grade so harshly and two, they are 1000% clear in their instructions.

One of the question was ""list evidence, numbered"" or ""the outline should look like this, hypothesis, conclusion', evidence""

I really didnt know if that meant i had to write everything down in my own words, or just complete quotes.

So im on my second emai of the day, because i wait for a response for the first email, then i move on to another hw that i also feel needs clarification.


And i think this is my 5th email for the week (theres a lot of homework)

I wish i could trust myself but i couldnt bear if i did a simple mistake. And result me in an A- or B. Like getting down a letter grade is easy to do In heavy weighted assignments.

Specifically I was wondering if anyone had ever gotten knowledge on certificates that could be useful, courses online that are reputable enough to mark down, etc. Even if not communication-specific, I'm just wondering if anyone ever pursued something similar.

Reason I ask is I didn't start taking college too seriously until this year and it's a little late or labor-intensive for me to start pursuing a minor. I've been fine with that thus far as my major has already required me to declare a sub-group within communication, but I'm worried that it won't be enough for my resume.

2023-11-05,1699200938,College is making me angry at everything,"So, I don't usually post on Reddit, but I wanted to see if anyone was experiencing anything similar to me.  I'm a junior at college up North and about 4 hours away from my hometown (where my boyfriend and best friends are).  Being at school makes me miserable and negative about everything.  I used to have quite a large friend group up here in freshman year, but since I stopped partying and drinking we've parted ways and I've grown to resent the people who I used to hang out with.  I lived with 3 of them last year in an apartment and they were probably some of the worst roommates imaginable.  Since then, I've moved into a new apartment with much more mellow roommates with whom I'm not close, but I enjoy talking to them occasionally.  However, I usually find myself in my room and avoiding all human contact during my free time.  This is what I like while I'm here.  I don't like socializing with the people around me at school because everyone and everything makes me SO angry up here.  I find that I get angry at the littlest things and I have negative thoughts all the time.  When people ask me to hang out or even if someone is just reaching out to talk to me, I get genuinely pissed off.  The thing is that when I go home or when I visit my friends, I don't feel this way.  I'm genuinely happy in my friends' company and I never feel burdened by them calling, texting, or making plans with me.  While I'm up at school, I'm constantly just waiting to go back home which I do about every two weeks to see my boyfriend.  It's just so draining to be so negative all the time.  I'm just scared that because I'm so negative here, it will impact the way I am at home or with my relationships that I truly care about.  I find that sometimes I pick fights with my boyfriend while I'm here, or I'll find myself getting annoyed with him in person when I'm anticipating having to go back to school.  For example, if I'm visiting home for the weekend and it's Saturday night (and I leave Sunday morning), I'll have this underlying dread about having to go back to college the next day and I'll start to lash out at him (I know this is super shitty of me and I'm 100% trying to work on it and be better for him).  It's too late for me to transfer schools and I wouldn't want to do that anyhow.  I know I can stick it out for the next year and a half, but I just want to know if this is something anyone else is dealing with or has dealt with before.  I'm looking for some tips and reassurance about this whole situation.  I know it's common to not necessarily like school, but I just have such a negative mindset and I want to truly change so that I can be a better girlfriend and just a better person while I'm up here.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ofaws/college_is_making_me_angry_at_everything/

I have 6 courses (they are all mandatory). The semester has 13 weeks. Together, I have no less than 5 hours of lectures (not including tutorials) every single day. With tutorials, this can add up to 7. To add to that, we are given extremely complex and large group projects in languages we don't know, in frameworks we're not taught, and every week, there is at least 1 project to submit, usually two. These projects include not just code, but multipage (10+) documentation in LaTeX, and usually a presentation. These projects take  A LONG time to finish, they are just that hard. To add to that, we have very difficult tests almost every week since the foiurth week, there's usually at least two. I am not kidding, these tests are 1.5 hours to 3 hours long from topics such as Theoretical Informatics, Advanced Statistics, Parallel Programming and Distributed Systems, etc.

There were 250 of us at the beginning of the semester (7 weeks ago). 56 people have already dropped out due to the insane workload. There is no free time, we all work CONSTANTLY. Anyone with worse than perfect time management just doesn't make it.

I am a sophomore and I live with my parents. Im essentially saving money and going to school so that I can graduate debt free by the time I graduate (or close to it). I am in a long distance relationship of two years, with trips being taken every 3-4 months to go and visit in Florida. I am majoring in Business Finance and I am having a hard time deciding between Arizona State University or ASU Online. I was committed to ASU in person, full time, until about a week ago. With my next semester coming up I need to make decisions and these are tough ones to make. I have a dream of working for a professional sports team, preferably the NBA. All of the major pro sports teams are in Phoenix with plenty of internships, and I have the connections that can help get me into them. As I mentioned earlier, I am in a long distance relationship and it takes time and money to go and see him every couple months. I am heavily considering moving to Florida, while pursuing my degree online, paying in state tuition while working. Obviously moving will remove me from any sports connections I have in Arizona, however there are plenty of sports teams in Florida. Travelling costs will be cut down by moving, but all other living expenses should be relatively unchanged compared to living in AZ. Obviously, I would also be working full time. My thinking is if worst comes to worst and my relationship doesnt work out, I can always move back to Arizona and continue my education in person on site. What do you guys think? Is it stupid to throw out those connections to speed up a 3 year timeline of my relationship? Am I being impatient? I guess another con is sacrificing my in person college experience, however I am the type of person that doesnt go out as much as other typical college students. I dont mind being a homebody, however at the same time I feel like I might look back and regret not living out my college days.

My other option is to defer my offer and study a year later, and next year I can work full time (I have a potential job lined up), save up and then move out to a place near the campus the year after. Id also travel and do some other things in my gap year.

   This is a weird question but let's say I struggle with algebra I'm gonna struggle and not be able to understand any of the other future concepts of other classes! At what point can I say I have the ability to truly learn anything?

  I have a very low IQ among 69 according to doctors that was ages ago tho. I want to be an astrobiologist so learning and education is something I value very much. However, much of my learning is very extreme for example if I'm studying for a simple history class people review for probably 2 hours I on the other hand have to review take notes and study for over a week straight. 

  I'm doing biology class and a lecture takes me a full 2 days to learn. There's also a issue of memory yes my memory completely erased what I learn a day after learning it's really bad. 

    
  Oddly I have found a way that my brain helps me learn some advice  for those who struggle: Explain to yourself like your explaining to an audience your concept. 

I am just extremely self conscious about my intelligence. I work day and night studying and I'm persuing my dream career no matter how hard it is.

2023-11-05,1699162678,"missed an assignment worth 20% of my grade, i am so bad at college and wanna leave lol","i am not really asking for advice about the late assignment because there is nothing i can do since the syllabus says no late work allowed. 

even in high school, i was only okay at school, but i managed to get into a relatively prestigious college. my first semester of college, i ended up with a D in one class, but that was mainly due to a confusing professor. i still ended up with a 3.5 GPA for the semester overall. however, after second semester of sophomore year, my gpa dipped below 3.0, and now im a junior and i cant seem to get my gpa up. 

i havent failed any classes, but i just feel like im not built for college life, or life in general. i have adhd and autism, and it makes things hard, but other people can survive with it. i genuinely think maybe im just not good for school. i havent failed a class, but i consistently get B-s, which makes above a 3.0 nearly impossible for me. 

it just feels like theres always something. second semester freshman year, i got covid right at the end of the semester. fall of sophomore year, one of my best friends unexpectedly died during finals. and this semester has been more unexpected death, a terrible off campus apartment, and my car breaking down making it virtually impossible for me to get to class for two months straight since i live in an area with terrible public transportation. but even without all of that i am simply just mediocre and unmotivated. i mean sure, the other things i just listed contributed to why i didnt turn in this specific assignment bc but my terrible brain truly just forgot. i cant make it remember no matter how many sticky notes i use. 

and thats just academic stuff, my social life is also terrible. i got to a cliquey small school, and i barely have friends. on top of the academic distress, there is also the looming feeling of crippling loneliness. i barely had a support system through the aforementioned events, and i lived off campus away from home. the lack of friends and lack of a high GPA when everyone else seems to be doing well in those areas just adds to the imposter syndrome i originally was able to convince myself was all in my head. 

i constantly feel like i made the wrong choice. maybe i would be better if i just went to state college and lived at home, or if i didnt even go to college at all. i think about dropping out, but id have to start working asap, and i dont wanna work some terrible customer service job either, ive had enough summers of that. i just feel so stuck. ive already put thousands into my education at this school, and it feels to late to commit to anything else. im looking into moving back home soon, i live an hour away, but i dont know. this semester ive actually been doing well with assignments but i truly screwed up missing this assignment, and ive added yet another B- to my GPA, guaranteeing yet another lack of a 3.0! fml lol",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17o5bef/missed_an_assignment_worth_20_of_my_grade_i_am_so/

for some added context, we were both placed into a medical dorm together because I have a disability and she struggles with anxiety and insomnia. On top of this the recent events happening in the world right now affected some of her family members (shes jewish) Everything was perfect. The first few weeks of college. now my roommate completely stopped talking to me. I swear we were literally best friends and we were relating to each other having late night talks and everything but now after midterms, its like a switch flipped. for the past few weeks. She has barely been talking to me like its just pin drop silence in the room 90% of the time. now my RA dropped the bomb on me and told me my roommate wants to leave and get a single room for herself. She did not tell me any of this prior. my RA said the reason why she came to her is because she struggles with insomnia and pretends to sleep while I am awake this entire time without telling me that shes struggling and now she wants to move. i hey dont know how to react.",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17nxw0n/my_roommate_ghosted_me/

A common argument is that, while online degrees have had a negative reputation in the past, their quality has improved so much over time, and they have become so much more common, that today many employers no longer apply a stigma to them. It is also said that as long as the college is accredited, there is no real difference between an online and a traditional degree. However, I have also seen people say that an online degree is essentially worthless, and that even the worst traditional institution is superior to it.

I (20M) currently have about two years worth of college credit down my belt (approximately 59 college credits). Ever since I finished high school Ive been working very hard academically and have done alright.

With that being said Im starting to realize that Im not necessarily ready money-wise for school. Im ready mentally, I know I can thrive. But the cost of college makes me worry more than anything.

Additionally my job makes it so that I have to be very selective to what I do, and I would really love to consider online programs that I can turn over to a real university in my final year. But the thought of all this distresses me more than anything as community college is about to wrap up for me.

(It could help to mention that I have hard times focusing)
I am a college freshman (law) and I hate what Im studying.

 I wasnt interested in law, but it looked like the only academic subject that I could pick. I thought Id get interest once in there, but I like it even less than before (the atmosphere, people, way of talking, organisation&).

The only reason I stay is because a degree gets you more choices in life (professionally speaking), and after not really having the choice on what to study, I dont want the same to happen the rest of my career.

In highschool, I could at some point put myself to work because it was either interesting or at least not VERY interesting, but now, I find it actively uninteresting and cant even read my lessons for long.

My parents have done too munch to offer me a comfortable life, and are happy that Im supposed to spend a year studying in an other country (which I dont like but again, double diploma= more choice) but I dont know if I have the level to.
I dont want to disappoint them.

Because of that, I really want to finish to both make them proud and to leave this field that I dont like.

2023-11-04,1699114798,transcript hell,"Has anyone ever ran into this quandary? Back in 2005, when I was like 23, I applied to a community college for classes. I was accepted, paid the tuition, registered for classes and then like a week before classes started, had a change of heart and decided to move out of the state. I officially withdrew, got all my money back, and moved on with life. 

Since then, like, maybe 2010ish I had gone to college in another state, graduated, worked for a whole decade and then decided I wanted to go to nursing school. I applied to nursing school, sent only my transcripts from the school I went into 2010 and one other community college I went to, got accepted and then graduated from nursing school in 2022 w/ an associates. 

I just decided in the last month to go further w/ the nursing degree and applied for a BSN, which is basically just a bachelors in nursing. Applied w/ the info from my nursing school and my other college from 2010.

A few days passed and Ive been following my application status and see they got all my transcripts, and then get an email from them asking for transcripts from the 2005 school that i enrolled to but never actually attended. Honestly I had completely forgotten about it, it was almost 20 years ago.

So I thought no big deal, called up that school, went thru a phone menu from hell and ultimately got thru to what definitely sounded like an outsourced 3rd party customer service line. They referred me to Parchment, which I did go to. Filled out the info and sent it in. A day goes by and Parchment emails me with an automated message and tells me there is no record of me at this school. 

I called back, went thru the whole call menu fiasco again and tried to explain the situation again to another person, who just pushed me back onto Parchment. I reiterated my scenario again, and I hear her click a few keys, and then basically tells me to thru Parchment again.

At a loss, I just hung up, looked up an email address for the school and send in this long winded email explaining the situation again. I get a reply an hour later telling me to call the same number I had called before and reference a ticket number. I did just that, and then basically get the same response as I had the previous two times: Submit a request thru Parchment. 

Im assuming since I completely withdrew before classes started, I dont even show up as having a W and therefore a transcript for me doesnt exist, but yet I appear to show up in whatever clearinghouse database that exists out there that colleges look at it. I just find it kind of funny the other handful of colleges I went to before never brought it up.

Obviously I plan on contacting my new and hopeful college on Monday to explain, but Im curious if this has ever happened to anyone before?

Like, I tried to Google this specific scenario and I yielded nothing similar to my dilemma. I was just wildly curious what the outcome was if this has ever happened to anyone else? 

Now I just feel wildly inconvenienced that I've already spent several hours working on resolving this and getting nowhere. If theres a clearinghouse that has all our data, why cant admission offices just pull the data they need without sending admits on this wild goose chase?",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17np5i8/transcript_hell/

2023-11-06,1699284784,"I have 6 handicaps, including a brain tumor. I'm studying abroad, but can't bring myself to go to school. Not sure what to do","By the way, I'm not in the US, so things may work differently at my uni regarding handicap laws and whatnot. I'm also on a throwaway because I don't really want to worry people in my life about this.

I've reached my breaking point today, and left school in the middle of the day because of it. I have Cushing's Disease from a brain tumor. This can cause major memory and concentration problems, difficulties seeing even with glasses, migraines/general illness, etc. I also have diagnosed ADHD, OCD, depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety, and a couple of doctors suspect I have autism, but it's a very long and expensive process so I haven't done it. Furthermore, I also have difficulties physically writing, although I haven't quite figured out why that is as I haven't had my appointment for that yet. This has led to professors getting irritated with me over my need for computers/phone to write notes.

It's at the point where even my classmates are irritated with me because I'm not very helpful brainstorming or writing on group projects even if I try my hardest. I also misunderstand things sometimes because of the language barrier and my general difficulties with social cues and also hearing people speak in general, which led me to accidentally laughing at someone's grandma dying (long story, but I apologized). I had a panic attack in class when the professor asked me to interpret things he was saying into another language, because I was not able to remember what he literally just said due to the complete lack of short-term memory. I think it's because my classmates all looked at me confused when I couldn't answer.

I really want to finish my degree and go to school as I previously enjoyed those things, but now every time I go to school, something bad happens and it triggers my social anxiety, making me run away again. I don't like going to school and being yelled at by profs or irritating/angering my fellow classmates on accident.

Ironically, I do fine on exams. Last year, I didn't go to school for pretty much the whole year due to mono and just showed up to the exams, and passed with honors. I know the material and don't really even need to go to class to do them.

I also have a couple of internships I'm doing right now and I'm doing very well in them with no complaints. In fact, I'm going above and beyond and feel in my element there, and am always on time with no absences. It seems to be school specifically that's troubling me, rather than a work environment in general.

I have no idea what to do in this situation. My school is aware of my handicap status but not to the extent of how bad it is. Do I ask for a meeting with them and see if I can skip classes entirely, given my grades are fine whether or not I go to class? (I use PowerPoint presentations and notes) Do I see if they can just ask all of my profs to just stop calling on me in class and let me observe? Will those things even help? I don't want to drop out, because I only have one year left of my bachelor's.

The only hope I have of scraping by with a C is to get 100% on all my exams, quizzes, and homeworks which is unlikely. Unfortunately, I wont be able to take any of major specific classes for next semester unless I pass calc first. I already completed all my ged eds save for one (which Im currently taking) so if I retake calc next semester (spring) it would be the only class Id have that semester. It would push everything back by a semester and delay my expected graduation. I checked and the class isnt available over the winter so spring would be the soonest semester I could retake it. 
I just feel like such a failure and cant imagine how to break the news to my parents that I may have to delay graduation due to my own negligence.

Edit: Im taking Calc 1 and the class is fully online with no class meetings or recorded lectures. Every week there is homework posted on MyOpenMath and the quiz or exam is released on Thursdays and due on Sunday by midnight. Were expected to take the assessments on examinity for proctoring to prevent cheating. 

MyOpenMath is structured so that the quiz tab is lowkey hidden compared to the homework. The link to the homework is clear in blue, but the link for the quiz takes 2 clicks to access so I tend to overlook when its due and dont check examity to complete the weeks quiz. However, the thing with examity is that it doesnt let you take the test if youre an hour away from the deadline (midnight). I found this out the hard way when I logged to take my exam (worth more than quiz) at 11 pm and wasnt able to access it which caused me to not take it and get a 0. I assume this was a fluke or an issue on my end but it happened with the second exam as well. 

In case youre wondering why Im doing math tests so late at night its because my little brother is super noisy and doesnt like sleeping alone. So I have to go to bed with him so he sleeps then get up later do my work nice and peacefully. But its own fault for waiting until Sunday and procrastinating.

I like to use the ice machine and I understand they are never super clean. However, there was a dangling piece of black slime coming out of the machine. It was not rubber or a piece of the machine but honest-to-god slime. I ran out of the dining hall to retch and didn't go back cause obviously someone would've noticed that.

This morning I go for breakfast and it's still there. I finally alert the supervisor and I watch as she just wipes it off with a napkin and pretends like it's fine. No bleach or sanitizer. No closing down the machine. I feel sick, this could make people seriously ill. I can't get in contact with the head of dining services or find who it is in the first place.

2023-11-06,1699277436,Advised to change major by Dean,"Since I transferred last fall, my entire college journey has been a nightmare. Initially, I had my heart set on a CS major.

As a result, I mwitched to a major in cognitive science, which Im not passionate about, and Im expected to graduate in the summer.

I was told that they initially assumed I had CS experience, despite my transcript showing no CS classes. Its incredibly frustrating that they didnt inform me about the recommendation against pursuing CS earlier, and now Im faced with the problem of becoming a part-time student.

 I really want to avoid being a part-time student and commuting, as the daily 2+ hour drive on the highway would take a toll on my car.

I've even considered changing my major so that statistics wouldn't be a big deal or so I won't have to take it at all. Please don't judge, I am really feeling at a loss of emotions because I just want to do well and to graduate in May, but it feels like I'm just stuck having this low gpa and wondering if I'm even going to graduate in May because of this one statistics class. If anyone has any tips or wants to PM me about what I should do, please do. I've thought about tutoring, but it feels like I'm so far behind that even tutoring wouldn't help me. I've thought about asking other students for help, but it just feels like everyone is so ahead of me.

2023-11-06,1699237925,Searching for colleges with nice scenery/outdoors/nature,"Im a senior in the seattle area and Im gonna be honest- Im pretty late to creating my college list. I have a couple ideas of where I may want to apply and have applied early action to Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR) and Western Washington University (Bellingham, WA). I have toured both and I enjoy the amount of greenery. Especially with western- bellingham is so beautiful with its forests and the beach. Although it would take some adjustment to a drier/less mountainy green area like seattle it would be ok. I have like a 3.8 unweighted gpa and a couple good extra curriculars. In no way am I shooting for an ivy because I know I would be INCREDIBLY unhappy in an extremely competitive school. I dont even know what I want to major in. In general I just love nature and it brings me a lot of happiness so Im trying to find schools that will be that. Id be totally fine going to school in a city but I wouldnt like the lack of greenery (depends on the city I guess). I dont care about location in the US- Im really just looking into everything at this point. However it is more likely I will be somewhere in the west so I can have WUE financial aid. 

Other things Im looking for and am open for suggestions about:
- diverse schools
- schools along the coast
- schools with nice people and good student life in general
- geographically diverse
- schools in good cities/towns
- strongish lgbt community

2023-11-06,1699237468,"Going into my second semester of junior year, realizing I'm regretting my major and wanting to switch.","I went into college majoring in film production and throughout my freshman and sophomore years, I was deadset on it. I decided to take a mix of gen eds and major classes each semester. This year, I'm realizing that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I enjoy it as a hobby, but the more I do it, the less I get satisfaction out of it. In my classes, I can do the things required, but everyone seems so happy/excited about it while I just simply am not. I'm in a film production club at my school and I have not enjoyed my time there this semester. 

I took two AP courses in high school, Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A. I absolutely loved these courses. The teacher was horrid but the material I found to be so much fun and so interesting. I got a 4 on both exams. I transferred them in to my current school which filled some elective credits for my current major.

The more I look into computer science, the more I'm interested in it. I spent last summer trying to teach myself Python but I'm horrible at teaching myself (was working 50 hour weeks that summer too) so I didn't learn much, but I had so much fun learning about what I could and the concepts were extremely interesting.

Here comes the issue. I'm really regretting my choice of major now. Not to mention the salary comparisons in the workforce. I'm already almost 3.5 years into college and I was looking into what would transfer over if I switched and (to absolutely _no one's_ surprise), only the gen eds transfer over. I would need to take an extra two years if I were to switch. The school I'm at right now has a relatively cheaper tuition as well, but money still plays a massive role into my education for me and I would hate to take out more loans (all federal, thankfully).

Part of me wants to stick it out with the degree, but the other part wants to switch, spend the extra time and money, but then get the CS degree. It would likely be easier to pay off the loans in that field vs. the film field. I also have enough credits to minor in my current major, so I was thinking just minor in it.

I wish I thought about this earlier in my college career but hindsight is 20/20. I'm hoping to find some advice from someone who has been in a similar situation/had similar feelings.

Its not a lot of assignments in the first year, but I let them not get done, and they are piling up. Not showing up to lectures, not turning in assignments, not paying attention in lectures, taking notes without understanding what I am writing down, and repeatedly not checking emails. I even realized that I shouldn't have picked a business major because of future paychecks but instead picked a major I would see myself in. I've tried making up the work and attending regularly, but I am not all that there. I've tried to bring this up with my mother, but she said it would just put us in debt early on and I should just stick through it until at least the end of this semester, then I can request a change in major.

I only recently found out about symbolab and wolfram alpha.

Seeing as I'm going into Eco Engineering, I have many more math, engineering and science classes ahead of me.

2023-11-06,1699233273,Madness,"Need advice on my current academic situation. 2.2 gpa

Here's my story. After graduating from high school I decided to attend Arizona State University thinking it would change my life forever moving across the country. By the first few months of my spring semester as a freshman, my roommate had turned on me and started to binge drink everyday of the month and would interfere with my health and studies. I can't lie and say I didn't partake in it most nights. I was in the process of joining a fraternity as well so that didn't help with keeping consistent grades in school. My mental health was out the window by then so i decided to quit everything i had started there that year and finish online back home. Once the Fall semester rolled around I decided to try it again even more confident then the first go around at ASU. i lived in an apartment with two really good guys but one would buy weed every week and i very quickly became a heavy stoner smoking pretty much everyday. showing up high to class. it was a very sick time for me. I also decided to join the club baseball team at ASU that semester. By the end of the semester i couldn't control my unhealthy habits and it had once again ruined my education. I failed every single class. I was then forced to drop out of ASU. I came home got myself together but was in a deep rage for 3/4s of this year. became very alone. Just worked at minimum waged jobs everyday. By August I decided to transfer to Bowling Green State University in Ohio. I was the most confident i've ever been in my life entering this semester. I was on a mission for a fresh and better start for myself. I started out the first month well with good grades and getting initiated into fraternity. But my mental health quickly went again. I was having panic attacks 3/7 days of the week and I ended up finishing the semester with a 2.2 gpa. I can't believe my life has come to this point but i really don't know what my next move should be considering how bad my college experience has been. i really can't afford to fail anymore classes and i just can't seem to figure out how to balance my social life with education. i feel like meeting people and building relationships is really big in college. lmk what you guys think",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17or4nc/madness/

2023-11-05,1699226823,Horrible time after college. Can any relate?,"After graduating I didn't get a job like I thought, after applying for everything I could find.
It was really degrading to see nobody would hire me, when I knew I would provide value. For the past three years I felt like university would be my ticket out of hell, but it didn't work out that way.

By the time I graduated I was on top of the world, I felt like the best I've ever been mentally and physically.

Sadly, after that I had to go back to the only places I could get hired, and work in miserable manual labour.

After 1 year of the worst job I've ever had. I had to stop working due to a bad back injury which is still not better 1 year after I quit. The job I worked was meant to be an gap year before I went back for postgraduate studies. 
Instead I was so overworked I developed severe chronic fatigue that I could barely get through a day, but I kept enduring because I don't know my own limits and I've always been a crazy hard worker.

So the past year I've been on unemployment, I used up all my savings, and I'm basically disabled. 
It has been horrible and the past 7 months I've been in the darkest pits of human misery imaginable. 
I don't know how I have refrained from suicide, but I won't give up.

Now, I am thinking to try to transitions into Tech after I get a Comptia cert. But my future is very unclear. I can't afford to go back to university.

It's a shame, but if I never had that job that injured me, I would probably already have my postgraduate degree right now, and I wouldn't be disabled. It has really got me down very very low.

2023-11-05,1699218663,At a Crossroads Between Math and English.,"I'm in my third year of undergrad and I am nearly finished the core requirements for a regular math degree. I originally intended to earn an honours math degree but I am not so sure anymore. 

As I begin taking upper level math courses, I find that much of the material is very similar to things we've already learned. Though I do quite well with math, I find myself more and more disinterested as the math becomes more abstract. I feel that I have learned enough math to benefit me in most any job. And that learning more math would be mostly superfluous.

I have always been interested in english. I love to write. Even though I struggle with writing far more than I struggle with math. I think that the communication skills and critical thinking skills that I would learn from pursuing an english degree would benefit me more than the logic skills I would learn from pursuing an honours degree in math.

My decision now is between completing an honours degree in math or completing a double major in math and english. I'm leaning towards the double major. But I feel guilty for giving up on math when it is something that I am good at (and something that is employable).

I'm in a higher level art studio class that self-directed and since the beginning it's like my drive to create art is just not there. It comes in brief moments of inspiration but does just as soon as it's born. I've had nearly 4 weeks to get this shit done but I've squandered every minute, hour, day, and (now) week up to where I am now. 

I currently have 2 incomplete 18x24 drawings and 0 completion on any of the 8 or so smaller drawings I implied I'd be bringing for Tuesday's critique. And it's not like I don't know what to do, I planned out at the beginning of my semester what my subjects and pieces would generally focus on. I'm to create drawings from a fictional world I created, semi-abstract pieces made of ink and charcoal, and bugs, marmots, and landscapes. I have all these drawings ideas written out to generally follow since the beginning of the semester and yet I've only completed one.

WTF is wrong with me, why haven't I had the energy to create artwork!? Why can't I muster the will to see just what I can really do!? I want to express myself through my work and yet I'm hesitant, too scared to begin the process. It's such weird and uncomfortable feeling: wanting to create art yet fearing that I'll hate the results. I'm too scared to attempt drawing and it disgusts me. I think of so many great things I want to draw and yet I can't bring myself to start.

Hey yall! Im a junior at a small liberal arts college in Ohio (college of wooster). After having a sort of existential crisis and realizing I absolutely hated studying history, this year I switched to computer science after extensive discussion with my advisors and the chair of the cs department. Im pretty behind since Im basically taking freshman year classes as a junior but they said id be able to graduate on time if i take some classes over the summer.

i also planned on getting an internship this summer, but i feel like being behind + my school being not well known puts me at a significant setback. I also would only really want to do an internship in Columbus OH (where I plan to go to graduate school, OSU) or somewhere in Asia (where I plan to move later in life). I study Japanese regularly so Japan would be ideal in that regard. 

Either way, I feel pretty hopeless about even having a chance of getting an internship. Im from a small school, Im behind in the major, and since I have a learning disability my GPA is not the greatest. My school doesnt have the best career center either to help me so I will have to look on my own. Seeing people here with GREAT qualifications getting rejected left and right only increases my fears. I feel like a fish out of water.

2023-11-05,1699211942,Switching schools?,"Hello! I found myself in a bit of a difficult situation recently, and was wondering if anyone had insight on what I should do next. So for some background: I'm 22 years old, and up until a year ago, had been going to a community College while I decided what I wanted to major in. I finally decided to major in special education, and transferred to a well-known college in my state. I managed to get all A's last semester, however this semester has been a completely different story. The way this program works, you must pass a set of criteria in order to move onto junior block. If you are missing ANYTHING you could be set back significantly, and may even risk being dropped from the program. Here's where the trouble begins: have a very difficult instructor who seems hellbent on making us miserable. However, she is adored by her colleagues, and is very good at hiding how spiteful she can be. Several classmates have complained to the dean, and nothing has happened. I have heard that she almost failed an entire class last semester. Unfortunately, there is a pretty good chance that I could have her Several more times before I graduate. She could even be assigned my mentor. She has legitimately made me question if college is worth it, if I have to see her every other day. I saw online that another college in my state has an online program for special education, however, I don't know if: A. I would be able to transfer if I fail this class, B. Would be able to transfer schools 3 times, and C. Be able to get any information on if this is possible with the resources I have.

2023-11-05,1699211868,seminar research class is annoying me!,"so i am required to take a research seminar course this semester. and everyone knows each semester is 15 (or so) weeks. in this class, i have to write a research paper that answers the research question i had to make up (that was approved by the professors and matches a ""theme"", meaning the research question has to be tied in a way to the ""theme"" the professors give you). 

anyway! so we started actually formulating our research question in class in mid-October (while other sections with this same course have been researching their topic for weeks), and learning how the library database works (which i have to comment....if you're in uni and don't know how a library database works....what did you do in high school or middle school???? i completely understand if the database UI was drastically different but it wasn't at all different from other databases i've seen).

and two weeks ago, we had to start looking at articles for our literature review. and last week, we had to ""choose our methodology"", and we're entering week 10/15 in the semester this week. we have only 5 weeks to actually do our method! and write a whole paper! and sure, the paper isn't long at all (8-10 pages with 6-7 sources). 

But like, you have to understand my perspective: I took AP Capstone in high school, and AP Research was held from September-May, and we had a whole school year to write a 20+ page paper, and we started our research from day 1 of school. And the methodologies are completely the same/similar for AP Research and now, as we cannot do experimental stuff (obviously), and we are encouraged and limited to surveys, content analysis, etc. and my AP Research teacher was very clear in what they wanted and gave us very direct instructions on how to write each part of the paper. Here, my college research class is ALL over the place, the Blackboard is super messy and during our lectures, the professors' instructions are all over the place and legitimately seem like they made up this information the night before so they can still say ""oh i did something during class today""

&amp;#x200B;

so i am left with 5 weeks to do a research paper with very unclear instructions. i know what parts of the paper i have to do, but even when explaining, the professors made zero sense and were all over the place. and of course you can say ""oh but you already wrote a research paper so use that knowledge"", to be fair i cannot remember the detailed instructions my AP Research teacher gave me because it's so much. and sure, it's 8-10 pages, but i legitimately have no idea how to start with this paper because the professors are so unclear (example....they did individual check-ins last week and i told them ""i am not sure what method to choose"" and they told me to do content analysis and historical, and when i asked them to clarify what they expect from me, their responses were very vague.)",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ojca1/seminar_research_class_is_annoying_me/

2023-11-07,1699339150,Should I (31M) quit my job and become a full-time student or continue working attend part-time?,"TLDR at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

Just turned 31 a few days ago and have decided Im going back to college for either Mechanical Engineering or Comp Sci for Data or AI/ML. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im currently living with my dad, have been all my life, and Im desperate to move out. Ive exhausted my options of securing a decent job that pays at least $60k, and I live in a MCOL so anything less than that is not going to work for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse, my cousins and family members around my age all have college degrees with well-paying jobs, working for Fortune companies, earning six-figures, driving Teslas, and living in $700k homes they bought before all the Covid madness. Meanwhile, I find myself stuck in my dads basement. Its a nice basement, and I still invite women over, but this is honestly not how I envisioned my life at 31. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, the other day I had lunch with my friend, Melissa 27F. We had a thoughtful conversation which lead to her telling me that she works two jobs, goes to school full-time for Aviation, and manages to live on her own. That really gave me perspective on how little Ive accomplished in my life, and its making me feel depressed, ngl. 

&amp;#x200B;

After much thought and humility, I want to take this opportunity to go back to community college for 2 years and then transfer to a university to finish my undergrad, but I have absolutely no idea where to even begin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im the only son of immigrants with no siblings, so Im sure there are a few grants and scholarships available, but Ive concluded Im going to have to take on the burden of student loans as my dad doesnt have the ability to help, unfortunately. 

&amp;#x200B;

So with that context, my questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on me quitting my full-time $44k job to go to school full-time (15+ credit hrs) and finishing in 4 years or less? 

&amp;#x200B;

OR

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get another job with similar pay but take morning/night classes part time, finishing in 6-8 years, if Im lucky? 

&amp;#x200B;

Im leaning towards being a full-time student, but Im curious to hear your opinions and suggestions on how I should accomplish this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, appreciate the help.

I have always studied extremely hard since my early teens, and I always got average grades (70% - 80%) and my parents have always been satisfied, but lately I've noticed that I really suck at taking tests.

I'm at the point where I can read a text book front to back, do hundreds of exercises and teach my classmates all of the subject matter, and I'll still get mediocre and even bad grades.

It didn't affect me too much early on, I barely passed Calc 1 with 61%, and I did well enough to he satisfied in other subjects, but last semester I got 15% on a test I studied for weeks and taught all of my friends what I learned (they all got above 70%). I ended up failing that class and it was the first time I've ever failed in a class/course

I was getting over it till today when I took a linear algebra test. The test itself was extremely easy and nothing I hadn't done before, but I really screwed up during the entire test and the second I left the classroom I knew exactly what I got wrong.

It's really eating me up inside and I just want to see if any other people are having or had similar experiences to me. I've heard all of the common stuff, like ""I'm getting too anxious"" or ""I'm not studying the correct way"" but none of those apply to me. I really know the subject matter, to the point where I can teach it to my classmates without any issue. I just really can't take a test.

Freshman year could not have been more perfect for me - Dean's List, joined a sorority, great friends. The 2nd semester was rough and I was extremely burned out. I spent most of the summer in my room, I guess kind of isolated away because of what had gone on. I was definitely going through it, I felt like everyone was growing up, getting jobs, etc. Friendships felt to be changing, home life was meh. I wasn't that happy but I was excited to start school again, thinking that I would feel better.

Long story short, I had to start therapy this semester for multiple reasons. I am able to keep up with my assignments and all, I am not falling behind. Studying has been harder now. I just have not been enjoying college life that much, it feels boring but also a lot at the same time. September and October had its ups and downs with my anxiety. My anxiety is definitely bad right now despite being in therapy. I've come home more weekends which I am okay doing but it is not making school easier. I feel good at home mentally in comparison to now. I was going back to school today and I had a full-on mental breakdown.. over just everything. So I contacted my school and asked if it were possible for me to do Zoom this week from home. I feel that these past few months I have worked on my mental health but school has been dragging it down as I make improvements. I just don't know what this means about me.. if I am in a funk and I just need time to feel better about life (I want to look into medication for my anxiety). I know it is okay to not be okay, but I just am worried about how this could affect my future.

I've never done well in any math course I've taken; typically, Cs. High school was a very, very rough experience for me\*, and I'm having various troubles in college as well (roommates mainly). Freshman year I failed the exam my college gives out to check if you're eligible to take calculus, but ""only"" by 1-2 points, so I still managed to slip in and start on calculus right away. I am very unhappy this semester because Calc III is difficult to manage, I have a heavy schedule and I'm not getting the amount of time I need to perform well in the class. 2/3 of my calculus teachers have expressed some concern regarding ability to perform well in the course and I'm very inclined to agree with them. The reason I've kept pushing onward is because I fear being left behind by my peers, I don't want to be left in a class with a worse crowd of people, and because I keep ""technically"" passing my courses. But academic karma has caught up to me at this point. I know I cannot just move on to Differential Equations or Linear Algebra after this and I don't know how to remedy my situation in Calculus III. My professor is avoidant of me in lab and isn't very approachable. I could not attend his office hours at the beginning of the year, and I don't wish to bother him with poor understanding of subject matter. I don't know if I can just ask him to fail me for the course. I don't know if I should give up on engineering for the same reason, but STEM is the only subject area I see as valuable and actually worth pursuing. I really wish I could start all over.

Long story short, I took a Medical Leave during my senior year in the Spring semester of 2015.

For the majority of 2015-2016 after leaving school, I was in and out of hospitals and did not even notice my loan situation. I noticed when my loans activated later in 2016 because I was supposed to have been graduated; my loans were automatically due. When they did activate, I was basically f'd because I had to pay the loans with neither a degree, a job, nor health.

I have tried to discuss this with the school and the loan servicer about this many times since then and have been so defeated into accepting the fact that I am paying for a semester that I did not attend. Occasionally I have the motivation and will power to even think about this (hence this post).

Is there any advice that anyone has on how to possibly make this right, or should I just accept that I have to pay for a semester of college that I did not attend because I was too sick at the time to even realize that the school charged me for it?",college,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pjcfs/loans_for_a_semester_i_didnt_attend/

I moved into a technical college and they listed me as nonresident because I had to live in the state for a year(for some reason this didnt happen at my community college) so the tuition was about 5k. The thing with the networking degree with the college is they only have online programs and hybrid. For hybrid its basically online but you do your work in a computer lab with the instructor there for any questions you might have. 
Its a month till the end of the semester and this week is the last week you can drop. Its self paced and ngl ive been slacking so im only half way through the sem. I can still make it but they workload is insane. Not only that but since its online its hard to understand.

2023-11-06,1699311852,Advice on potential major/career switch,"


Hi all. Im currently a junior at a highly ranked business school, and Im currently recruiting for consulting/marketing jobs. Although Im actively recruiting for these roles, Ive never really liked business nor the prospect of working in a corporate environment. My choice of going to school as a business major was in-part due to some external family pressure and internal pressure to find something stable. My school is also very well-known for business and I felt a sort of obligation to major in it for that reason.

Ive become increasingly depressed and anxious as a direct result of going through with my major and recruiting for the industry. Living in a major city has also contributed to this, and I cant see myself being able to handle the hustle environment for much longer. I have never felt like myself in my current academic/professional situation, and this feeling has turned my outlook on life to be increasingly negative in the past few months. Naturally my therapist, along with my friends and family, have strongly encouraged me to consider other career options, which has led me to give such options serious thought. I dont mind the prospect of making less money I dont aspire to own or rent things beyond modest means. Going to school for an extra year also wont be an issue, as most of my school so far has been covered via scholarships.

Ive been seriously considering becoming a history/education major and pursuing teaching as a career. I am far aware that teaching has its drawbacks, but the idea of being able to engage with a true passion of mine while doing work that actually means something (to me) seems much preferable to working in a job without that sense of personal impact (Im not saying corporate jobs are meaningless fwiw, just that they dont satisfy my sense of purpose i want from my work). 

I know there are a million next steps from here& Ill see what my career advisor has to say, but I would appreciate any candid input from you guys.

Edit: current plan is to continue recruiting for marketing/consulting until I find an internship for summer 2024 (which would eventually extend to a full-time position). Would ideally have an offer by early December, which would give me at least a cushion if I decide to switch into something else.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pfwqy/advice_on_potential_majorcareer_switch/

2023-11-06,1699308604,If you are wondering about getting a degree but you don't think you are smart enough here is some advice.,"I was professionally tested to have an IQ of about 69. Yes it was so bad I was placed in special education for many years. It wasn't until I gained passion for learning what I wanted to do. In which I became better. I am pursuing a degree in biology and may get into more so I can become an astrobiologist. 

  When I look at an IQ test I realize something it's not about how smart you are. It's about how well you can learn and how fast you can problem solve.  

  I'm mentioning IQ because I understand either you feel your dumb or you took an IQ test that says your dumb.  I think I can explain but best. 

  Imagine a genius 140 IQ he reads what he learns and advanced really quick to the next part, A guy with average intelligence will probably have to read it once or twice maybe take some notes and a 2 hour assignment takes them well 2 hours maybe 3 hours. 

  Now people like us who are mentally challenged. It's rough and that's something you are gonna have to understand. You are gonna have to watch videos on what your learning, read it, take notes, review it for a very long time and all for most of that information to flush out because we don't have a good memory capacity. Sleep and Eating? Barely because well your too busy learning materials that should take only  well no more than like 4 hours in multiple classes. It takes a average person 2x reading to learn it will take you about 10x if that makes sense. 

  I love learning I love it so much. However, it's been a complete nightmare mentally draining feeling like I'm not good enough but I keep pushing and pushing learning and learning.  Being dumb is not the end all be all in getting an amazing education it's just playing life in nightmare mode.",college,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pen3p/if_you_are_wondering_about_getting_a_degree_but/

He also cancelled the entirety of this week because his car broke down and said he'll give us activities on Canvas.

When we do have class, there isn't much I'm learning. At least 3 times we just played gartic phone or played games that have BIPOC representation. We've had a total of 5 assignments this semester, which are mainly finding BIPOC games and playing, and another assignment is to record screen time usage and write 100 words on what we think about it.(It's a digital technology class). 

He's new to being a professor and a really nice guy, and it's an easy A class but I feel like I've wasted time and money being in this class. Since he's a minority (I am as well), many of our classes have the undertone of how BIPOC people have a harder time in the tech world, and I appreciate the representation and understand the importance of highlighting the challenges faced by BIPOC individuals in tech, but it's become a repetitive theme in class.

Its BS.","This year I transferred from a private school to a state school with a good reputation so that I could finish my degree. At the beginning of fall term, some students in my major told me that the courses I have to take this year are going to be super difficult. Fast forward to midterms: I studied for a lot for my midterms, and then when I took them, I realized all the questions on the midterms were just questions taken word-for-word from the homework. This happened in all four of my classes. Prior to the midterm in one of my classes, the professor strongly emphasized to just study the homework. Im kind of pissed off because I studied for a long time and got a good grade, but some other people in my class got the same grade, even though they dont really understand the material. It seems like the college is just passing everyone along.

Why do some colleges do this? It literally feels like cheating. Im getting an A, but honestly do I deserve it? Im not being accurately tested on the course material.
What I dont understand, though, is some people are still getting bad grades on the midterms, even though all the questions are questions weve seen before!! Maybe if the questions werent word-for-word, more people would fail out of college, and the college would lose money? Idk, Ive never experienced this before at any other college.

At first the averages were low (60s), but now the averages are more around in the high 80s/low 90s. A true 100% has almost never happened (although several times, several students came very close with 96+ percent) except for two of the assignments, which are graded for completion. A handful of students are complaining that if a 100 has never happened then I am too harsh. Personally, I don't think 100s are a thing that should happen often or even be curved to. 

I do sometimes ""curve"" as in that if I see almost everyone get the same question wrong, I will just void it and give those points back to everyone (but not if it is a mistake that I have said during lab session and given them feedback on before).

When I started this assignment, I thought my (assignment names) were supposed to be in an essay format, but I realized last minute that I had done it wrong. I began re-writing my (assignment names) late last night which led me to submitting them late.

Hello, I'm struggling to choose which course is the best for lucrative jobs, job growth, and employability in the future. Pharmacy seems like the best option as a lot of bioinformatics - related jobs that I found require a PhD which I'm open to doing but that is an extra 4-8 years in university. However, bioinformatics align with my interests more than pharmacy because it is more research and IT based.  
I currently work in a pharmacy in s2/s3, so pharmacy may be the best in terms of employability because of experience. However, I dislike the customer service. So, I am struggling to choose which course to pick.

This semester has been a nightmare. I was gang-raped in August, fell out in a devastating way with one of my best friends in September, and last week my dog died.

The feedback I get from both of my professors is that they love having me in their classes, that I have great potential, and I'm smart. I'd like to believe that they are the kind of people that would appreciate knowing what's going on so that they have the opportunity to be gracious to someone who is trying really hard despite everything.

Class 2: It's an intro class I still need because my major reqs were updated. This class is closer, and it would still be cutting it close but I'm more likely to not be late for the next class. If I put this off, it will also conflict with that other class next year, however my advisor said if I don't get to this intro course, it's not a big deal because we can probably sub in one/some of my upper division courses.

So basically I can either stay at home and save nearly $200k or get away from home for $200k more.

2023-11-07,1699401156,Choosing a major is giving me the heebie jeebies. Any guidance?,"I am a senior in a high school that is utterly obsessed with getting its students either A) into fancy prestigious colleges or B) massive scholarships. And it definitely works for a lot of people considering the alumni I've heard about or personally know. Most everyone here is the stereotypical ideal for an admission candidate. We have a whole class dedicated to the college process, which means I'm forced to think about it even more than I would of my own volition.

The problem is: while our counselor is astounding when it comes to help with the actual application process, she has *zero* to offer in terms of deciding a major. She has repeatedly told me that I'm a ""dream to have at any campus"" because I excel at most every academic field and have ""such epic writing skills."" I genuinely do not think this matters nor do I agree with her, so please do not take this as bragging, I promise that's not the intention. But it means she thinks I could do *anything*, and as such just keeps telling me to do what I care about most.

I was raised with the idea that college is 100% solely for the sake of later acquiring a job. And, to an extent, I still hold this belief. But I do not have a dream job that is physically possible in the slightest, so I don't know what I should be majoring in. I always wanted to be a *musician* of all things, but my father made sure to crush the dream early because he wanted me to grow up to be either a computer scientist or a housewife. A failed musician of a kid would be ""embarrassing to the family name."" Which means that I can't exactly pull a 180 and major in songwriting because I was never given the opportunity to learn guitar, or piano, or anything (I've been trying to make up for lost time learning the first, but I clearly cannot get to a performable level fast enough for admission deadlines lol). 

I know that you can change majors once you're actually a student there as well as I also know a lot of universities don't require you declare your major immediately, but a good chunk of them have limits on changes (e.g. you can't move between colleges within a uni or majors are blocked by an audition requirement). I've only applied to public schools so far because I wanted time to clean up my more pressing essays instead of applying EA anywhere important, and at those I've gone for Mathematics as a major, but I don't really care about mathematics? Like, I know I'm very good at it (that's something I'm willing to brag a bit about), and it's always my favorite homework, but I'm not *passionate* about it. And if I truly was throwing passion away for the sake of thinking about college in terms of jobs, I guess I should be going for Finance or Statistics instead because those are more sought after?

I don't know. Somebody tell me how to figure this out, or tell me where to start rethinking please and thank",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17q8c6c/choosing_a_major_is_giving_me_the_heebie_jeebies/

I got my homework back and didnt see a grade written on top, and I checked our virtual system and didnt see a grade. 

When I went to speak to him after class he told me its because there was a question I did that wasnt assigned. I asked him what he meant and he showed me. Long story short, I misread and did question 26 instead of 36. He has a rule that something like that results in an automatic zero. I didnt really get it at first, and I said oh so I just got that answer wrong then, and he said no you got a zero. Then I realized he meant I got a zero for the entire homework set. 

I didnt really believe him at first, but he said its a rule he as its a way hes found students cheating off of each other in the past. Unfortunately for me, question 26 was assigned last semester, so not only did I misread, but I did a question that was assigned the previous semester which made me look bad.

I told him Id rather he think I was stupid than I cheated, and I didnt cheat. He told me since I confronted him he doesnt think I cheated and that if I hadnt spoken to him he wouldve thought otherwise. Then I started to cry, just because I was feeling overwhelmed, the class is difficult, and I really need to pass the class in order to take the next set of classes. Then I started to cry more because I was embarrassed. He told me not to cry and that I would be fine, and that he would assign a bonus homework. He said I made a blunder, which arent allowed in the real world and to think of it as a learning experience.

I tried to get it together but couldnt and was more embarrassed and cried some more. Then I just dipped without saying bye, and I feel bad.

Should I email an apology for my reaction?

It seems that  many teachers are downright depressed or burnt out. 

Students in my promotion are working their ass off (studying more than 10 hours a day week end included, working part time, no leisure or pleasure whatsoever, no girlfriend and barely time for family)

Some materials are outright outdated and so is the teaching system for some classes. Not happy with it? The answer will most of the time be ""Yes it sucks and so does life. College is about preparing you for life""

I often times have my college project groups ask for meetings late in the evening (invasion of privacy).

I see professors answering email at fucking 11 PM!!!

It seems that the common denominator here is that every party involved tends to answer the same way: ""It prepares you for life because life sucks and is shit"" (well actually not exactly that but along those lines)

Why finding work-life balance isn't more incentivised by college?

No wonder why suicide is on the rise and so is unhappiness.

2023-11-07,1699394343,Has anybody else ever survived 7 consecutive semesters of academic probation and graduated?,"Has anybody else ever threaded this needle? I successfully graduated college after 7 consecutive semesters on academic probation. I feel that this must be a highly statistically improbable event; I. think I am the only person in the history of my university to do so.

Some background- I grew up as a GT kid. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Tourette's syndrome in my early teens, and was proscribed adderall for the attention deficit issues. I graduated high school with 27 college credits, and went to a state school on a scholarship for Presidential Leadership Program, a specialized minor. I graduated high school right when the economy collapsed from the 2008 financial crisis, So I went in with financial issues.

My freshman year I made a stupid decision; I decided to go cold turkey on my adderall, be cause I did not want to be physiologically dependent on a chemical. I did not anticipate withdrawal. I couldn't get out of bed for three weeks as ten years of amphetamines worked their way out of my system. I went from  straight A's to failing 2 classes. This was a new experience for me, I had always been scholastically gifted, and this failure put me into a deep depression. Come spring semester, I had recovered and was ready to get back at it, but I found out I was formally put on academic probation by the university as my GPA was below a 2.0. This meant that I could only enroll in 4 classes a semester. One of these courses was a 200 level German course. I have a profound issue with learning foreign languages; I scored an 800 on the SAT verbal, but I just can't seem to crack others (I've attempted to learn 5- Latin, Spanish, French, German, Dutch). this 200 level course was a requirement to graduate, so I had to pass it. I failed this course 4 consecutive times.

From My second semester freshman year to when I walked at graduation, I was on formal academic probation. Academic probation exists in a narrow range of GPAs. Drop below the threshold, and you are kicked out. rise above the threshold and you are off academic probation. I had a 3.8 average in my major, but because I kept failing the language course over and over and could only take 4 classes at a time, The impact of the high grades in my core focus, averaging to the 0 of the F meant that my GPA per semester was automatically at 75%. I couldn't take any academic risks by taking courses i wasn't sure I could get an A in, even 400 level history courses. no pottery class for me! I had enough credits to graduate by Junior year, but I still didn't have the language course.

Each year of school the band for academic probation gets narrower and narrower. starting from a band of .40, by senior year the margin of error was .02. Junior year the band was only .10 of a grade point.

I Literally have never heard of someone graduating under these conditions, it was a statistical fluke that i was put into an administrative catch 22 that wouldn't allow me to take enough classes to climb out.  How unusual is this?

Post script- After graduating I toured around Europe for a while as a muralist, and after that jumped into the corporate world and work as a international Business Director in tech, so it all worked out well in the end.

2023-11-07,1699394295,Issues with roommates,"Hello all, Ive been living in the dorms now for about 3 months now and have had some complications with my roommates. The first issue actually occurred ured the first week of school. In my hometown I always had a small pocket knife on me wherever I went. I worked a blue collar job where needing a knife was handy and I fished a lot. So I brought my pocket knife to school with me (perfectly legal knife under 2.5 per state of CA). When I came here I know I wasnt gonna carry a knife everywhere out here because that would be ridiculous per the circumstances of where my school is located. But I still brought it and would hide it under my clothes in my drawer. I used it for cutting open boxes and packages in the mail (THATS IT). I never flaunted it nor played with it in any way, didnt even talk about it. But a week in I got reported to my RA by my roommate, (well call him Jason). The RA was super nice and told me to just throw it out and it wouldnt get escalated. So instead of arguing about the legality of it, I just avoided the conflict and threw it out. 

I found out it was him because when I explained why I had it and used it, he said we have scissors, you dont need a huge weapon to open packages. So after that I knew he was gonna be an issue but I didnt treat him differently or have any sort of rash treatment towards him.

Fast forward a month and a half. My other roommate (well call him Jack) had a girl sleeping over every single night for 2 weeks straight. As it was getting in the way of my studies since they would be asleep until 12 and 1 in the afternoon. Me and Jason talked about it together and said we would just tell him to stop doing it and confront him. Jason didnt want to do the confronting so once it was just us 3 in the room, I closed the door and we all talked it out. Jack was super cool about it and there were no hard feelings or anything. This didnt get reported to the RA or school because there was no need to as we discussed it together as men.

Now for some background information, we have a room with a balcony a few stories up. Now recently, I threw a banana off the balcony to one of my friends (yes I know, extremely stupid and immature). As it was just something funny and humorous, nobody cared or took it seriously. But my roommate felt the need to report me to a behavior counselor at the school. 

I come back a few days after it happened and open an email that says I have a mandatory appointment with a school counselor. As it was addressed with only my name to it, I asked Jason if he had received the email too. He said no. So then was when I knew it was him that reported me, but to make sure I knew, I made up a lie to him about someone else throwing stuff when nobody was in the room except for me. He told me it wasnt true and that it was because I threw a banana and almost hit someone. Which he wouldnt know if it was true or not because he wasnt in the room when I described the lie. So at this point I know he reported me. I didnt say anything harsh or make it seem like I knew in any way shape or form. 5 minutes after the conversation, I reach behind him to grab a napkin and he turns his head incredibly fast like he was scared of something. Then 5 minutes after this, I leave the building and look up to see him looking over the balcony AT ME. (He never uses the balcony.) 

So I dont know what this dudes deal is. He never confronts us about issues he has with us but instead escalates things to nearly the highest level. It really sucks too because I have another 7 months living with this lunatic but Im debating on switching rooms. Its hard to outweigh the benefits and drawbacks though as we have the one of best rooms on campus and the fact that Ive made lots of friends with my entire floor. I would love to hear recommendations on what I should say to him, or if I should just move out to prevent this guy from getting me kicked out for bullshit accusations.",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17q5qnc/issues_with_roommates/

My main issues are this:

Im not sure what I want to do in life anymore. I used to want to pursue marine biology but got stuck at a state college in the middle of the city( non coastal) so I am taking the required courses for Biology major, but even then am questioning if I am just wasting my time. Its too late for me to just start over and even then start over as what? 

Another issue is that Im just done with college. Ive reached a point every single semester where I do horribly mentally because of just everything with life, work, assignments and grades, social life , etc. Things everyone has to deal with, Tim not a unique case I know. Which is what pushes me to keep it up- knowing Im doing better than some people. Im doing fine mentally this semester but I think it is in part due to the fact that Im not fully invested in my classes.  If I fail my classes this semester I might just take the next semester off.

Main issue is sense of self and self sufficiency. How am I going to find a stable job if I dont know what I want to do, what careers are even out there, etc. We spend all our lives going to school so we can then Spend the rest of it working. 

Do I continue the path Im on, try a coastal college, or take a break. ( Im leaning toward a break so I can ground myself and have some time to figure out what I can do, but am scared of falling even more behind than I already am )",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17q39fn/i_think_i_did_college_wrong/

2023-11-07,1699385082,Roommate is driving me and my other roommate crazy and I dont know what to do.,"So I (24F) am in college right now living in an on campus apartment. I have two roommates, lets call them A and B. A is a few years younger than me and a junior. B is older than both of us and shes a senior. A is autistic, and although she is very sweet, shes been causing a slew of problems with her inconsideration the entire semester. These are just a few examples: 

1) she does laundry from sun up to sun down almost every day. Thats not an exaggeration or a joke. For me its ok because I do my laundry once a week, but at the same time there are times I NEED to do laundry and shes got a load of clothes in there that wont be done for an hour. I know B is frustrated with this as well.

2) A takes out the trash when the trash isnt even close to full. At first it was fine but I bought trash bags and it feels like theyre being wasted. B has voiced her concerns about this as well. 

3) A can be very loud. Ill find that shes running up and down the hall when doing her laundry. There have been times that Im laying down to take a nap and I get woken up from all the noise. She goes home every weekend and when she comes back her parents come in and help her bring stuff in. They are very nice and I dont have a problem with them, but they are loud most of the time theyre here. 

All of this came to a head the other day. Her parents were in here helping her bring some stuff in, and B was in a meeting (Im guessing over zoom). I was laying down to take a nap and was nearly asleep when I heard B talking to A and it started getting a bit heated. I went out to see what was going on, and B was telling me what was happening. I tried to calm A down but she was so flustered and upset that I couldnt get through to her. When she gets upset she repeats the same things over and over. She usually just keeps saying shes sorry. Shes apologized to me multiple times about the other day even though Ive told her its fine. 

Another thing I didnt mention was that A has been walking around naked. I was leaving for class and I looked to my left as I was walking out the door, and A didnt have clothes on. I honestly dont want to see anyone naked, it just feels weird to me. Apparently a few days or a week or so after that, I heard B say something to A about putting in a towel. I asked B later what was going on and she said A was walking around naked in the hallway. She was checking on her laundry while she was naked. B said she told A to at least put a towel on, and A said sorry over and over and that was it. 

As I said above, B is very sweet, and Ive tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, since she is autistic. Ive tried to go easy on her because I also have a disability (mild cerebral palsy) and I know how it can feel having to work a bit harder to be better or do things right. But at this point, I am getting very very frustrated. Ive tried to talk to her and she just says ok and Im sorry over and over, but nothing changes. I dont know what to do.

2023-11-07,1699370059,Hot take: I cant wait to be done with college,"This is probably going to get downvoted, but I need to get this out. To preface this, dont get me wrong, I truly do appreciate having the opportunity to get this education and am beyond grateful to everyone in my life who made this possible. I wouldnt be where I am today without the hard work and sacrifices of so many people throughout so many years.

That being said, for me, college has not been as enjoyable as I hoped it would be. I know its still supposed to be a serious academic environment and its not all just fun and games, but considering the number of people who have told me things like college is SO fun, youre gonna have a blast! and you get so much freedom in college! I guess I feel kind of let down. For starters, I cant help but feel the constant pressure of having to maintain a solid social life because thats such a big part of college. As someone who used to be socially awkward and struggled a lot with making friends, I feel like to this day, I feel especially more anxiety and pressure to keep up a bustling social life due to those past experiences - as if I need to constantly prove to myself that I have friends and Im not a loner. Even in my second year here, though, I still dont really feel like I have as good of a social/party life as I would like, and I dont really have many close friends. Not to mention all the drama that happens between friends and roommates a lot of the time.

Also, at the end of the day- no matter how fun or exciting it can be- its still school, and I still feel just as stressed out, if not more, about all the work I constantly have to do and the looming deadline to declare my major. Plus, applying for internships, job hunting, networking, and all of that other stuff adds even more to that stress. Im not planning on pursuing higher education at this time, either, so I feel like the timeline to find a job is even more tight for me.

To be clear, I really am grateful that I can be here, but I would be lying if I said that I didnt wish I could just fast-forward a few years to graduation. I cant wait to just finally be finished with school, hold down a stable job, have a consistent daily routine, have more free time, and not have to constantly feel pressure to have a ton of friends or keep up a social life and image around other people.",college,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pwh5a/hot_take_i_cant_wait_to_be_done_with_college/

Hello reddit,

hope yall are well. So basically I am currently a mechanical engineer pursuing a minor in computer science but I am strongly considering switching the mech e major to an electrical major. However I have 2 options: I can either make the decision to switch next semester (I am a second year btw) and not be too behind, or I can accept a current internship offer I have right now in the field of mechanical engineering, and then see how I like that experience to make a final decision regarding switching. If I did this second option, I could change my major but it would set me back a good bit which makes me think that pursuing a Master's degree may be a more ideal option at the end of the day.

I didn't catch everything said during the conversation but I heard details about private conversations he had with administration where he ws mocking them, as well as the mention of being investigated for something about having a gun. While talking about guns the GA mentioned something about the admin investigating to see if he had a gun in his car while parked at the school as well as him making comments ""So what if I own a rifle! It's not illegal!"". For context, we are a Canadian University, so most rifles are very much illegal.

I have a professor that clearly does not enjoy his job and puts in zero effort and idk how to pay attention.

His lectures are recorded so I can go back and listen to them if I missed something, but fully attending to his recorded lectures is even worse than with his irl ones, he just says stuff like its a checklist.

Re-affine what you wrote on Virtue Ethics, Contractarianism, Moral Luck, Natural Law, and Divine Command - earlier. (8 points per Ethical Theory) 

So I defined in my own terms as follows

Contractarianism: the idea that you do what you say, even if other factors exist that would cause you to reconsider 

Virtue Ethics: the idea that we should strive towards the common good. 

Moral luck, the idea where someone is blamed for the outcome of a decision when they were not really in control of the variables.

Natural law: the idea that humans have an intrinsic order within them that they try to follow. 

Divine command, The idea that something is moral or not depends on the fact that something is commanded by god.

And I was punished for plagiarism, I would like to point out these are done in my own words. I didn't even look up definitions, just my own understanding, and my professor stated that it is plagiarism since these ideas aren't my own I have to cite a source for them.

Am I crazy? I feel like these are terms and don't need to be cited especially since it was covered in class, meaning I don't know the source, wrote them in my own words, and idk, some of them you could just intuit, especially Divine command. 

I feel like saying I plagiarized that is uncalled for. Like plagiarism is a term too, but it's used often and not cited, what's the standard for when a term needs to be cited?

I'm a software engineering student and in semester 3. I failed a ""practice OOP"" class. Basically, you go to the class, program, when you are done you submit your work so the professor can tell you to change the code. You need 750 points to pass. But I'm very scared and shy so I do all the projects without submitting anything. By the end of the semester, I got more than enough, worked up my courage and submit all of them. But she said it's too late and there won't be enough time to reviews all of them. So, I'll have to redo the class next semester.  

P/S: At first we heard she was a tester so she'll test all of the input cases and she didn't want any input bug. But moving towards the end she didn't even bother to check the input and she would rather ask us to add new features or change them. Despite this, I'm really annoyed when I don't validate the inputs so 90% of the time i spent testing and checking my program. That's properly another factor why I feel scared and submit my assignments late.

I want to ask your opinion,what should i do in this situation.

Let me introduce my self, I'm 20 years old boy from Europe. I try to not waiste any time and i try to spend time as efficient as possible, because I know, what I'm doing right now affect on my future life. With that said, im going in the gym almost everyday, taking diet very seriously (couting carbs, not eating any sugar envolved foods(only that comes from natural ones)), not drinking, smoking or vaping. I'm trying to do some creating some content during my free time, because I have a vision that it might change my life. I feel like studies aren't the thing, that you can become financially independent from.

In my family, I feel like I'm the one that is trying to improve as much as possible and spending every second as efficient as possible. They think weird about my diet, gym, but I don't pay attention to it, becausd I know this is the right thing for me, to become best version of myself. Ofcourse I love them, they treat me well and I'm thankfull them for doing it. 


Im september I started to study Software Engineering in university. I don't have to pay for it, because goverment pays. They let people who graduate from high school with a particular score to study free (at least in my country).Started well, got to know a lot people, university offered some kickboxing classes, I tried and really liked it.. Im not going to get on details, what I liked and what not, i'll go stright to the point. In this month we started taking tests. I pased some and didn't passed few(Math ones) and those hit me really hard, even tho im not a 'A' student. Why it hiy me hard, I think because I was really preparing for them for some time and I feel like, I waisted that time. Some students haven't study that much or haven't study at all and passed it. Ofcourse I'll have another try in December. 

The main reason why it hit me hard, because I try so hard in most of the things that I face, is because of my family. My overall goal is to make them financial freedom, so they wont care about my financial situation and they wouldnt have to worry about theirs.

So my question is, what to do in these times when something simple as a failed test can hit hard and can be quite hard to live with it ?",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qxrx3/failed_some_classes_in_university_need_some_advice/

2023-11-08,1699477852,Stressed about mark from professor,"I had a new professor that was very problematic. They only taught 50% of the material before the final and provided the wrong page numbers for study that were 100s of pages off, couldn't answer questions, and gave the wrong information for what was on the tests. The professor also personally attacked a few students in class close to the final and vindictively told the class they would add 5 weeks of material that wasn't taught ""for our benefit"" three days before the final. There were complaints to a professor standing as assistant dean, but I'd guess those never went through and someone was protecting this new professor. The only assignment passed in at the beginning of the semester was not marked until days after the final and was marked brutally. Because of all this, everyone I spoke with received low grades, but everyone was also scared of submitting a grade rebuttal because of the personal attacks. I ended up doing one myself for the assignment, as this was the only physical evidence I had. Just received back that they met with the professor and it was a ""fair"" marking with feedback and since the other student didn't submit a grade rebuttal with me (they said they would but never did), that was against me. 

I'm just frustrated that this professor got away with all this because most of it was anecdotal and that my class backed out of grade rebuttal.

2023-11-08,1699476707,Thinking of switching majors due to my friend's passing,"Serious replies only please.

I'm a sophomore in compe thinking of switching my major to biochem or chem. I'm taking a gap semester next semester, so I have some time to think about it.

The most impactful person to my life passed away recently (you can read about the background about it in post history but I won't delve), and I've been seriously considering switching my major to biochemistry. My friend was a biochem major who was really passionate about chem before the onset of his disorder. There's not much research about the disorder he had and it has no known cure. Before it got really bad, he said that he imagined making a medication that worked for it.

I've never liked my current major, but there's not many majors I can switch to since my uni's notable in engineering. My biggest passion is in anthropology, but given that I'm paying OOS tuition specifically to go to a top uni for my current major, it would not make any sense to switch to a major that is a.) low paying by nature b.) low in rankings c.) not rigorous from my experience with anthro courses. However, chem ranks pretty high at my uni.

At some point in my life, I had considered applying for bio/chem/biochem in order to become a psychiatrist or pharmacologist, which is an occupation I would've been passionate about. But I didn't want to go through the extra years of med school, and decided against it.

My current university ranks #6 for computer engineering, #8 for chemistry, and #19 in biochemistry.

My friends in chem suggested that I don't switch because chem is known to be difficult major at my uni and they've cried over the stress of lab reports sometimes even though they really like their major. People say that chemE and compe/ee are the hardest majors at my uni. And because of the way that the department is structured, core classes are offered fall sem or spring sem only, so it is really difficult to get the required courses. Also, I would essentially become a freshman again because my current major, compe, doesn't overlap with any chem curriculum courses. So switching majors would be a HUGE commitment and I don't want to switch more than once, if at all.

I talked to an advisor yesterday and they questioned whether I actually wanted to do compe, and I said no but that it wasn't viable for me to switch major to my actual passion and they agreed with me. They said that they would do some research for me to think of other options. My advisor said that my technical GPA was actually above average and something to be proud of even though I have been feeling really unconfident and depressed about my academic performance.

I am 100% sure that I would prefer biochem &gt; compe and I find it more meaningful, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to be a premed student. I would want to get into pharmacology eventually if I did and continue the dream my friend had, but I am unconfident in my ability to do that. Or if I would still want it once it became stressful, just like how it is for compe right now.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qvbiq/thinking_of_switching_majors_due_to_my_friends/

No, I'm not deathly afraid of leaving home or have some deep seated fear for me to psychoanalyze. 

But all the hype in high school (and, frankly, in community college to an extent) about getting away from my kinda rural area and going all across the state, or to different states? I just didn't get that. I feel for those with a toxic home life and that's why they're motivated to get out of the area, but I just didn't get that culture. I also understand if someone gets a big scholarship to go elsewhere. My brother, who is in hs, is also hyped about it, and I just..don't get it. (I'm not trying to make generalizations about the culture, this was simply the culture I personally experienced and I'm aware it can be vastly different elsewhere.)

I am simply...perfectly happy in the area that I live in. Do I have dreams of eventually going out of the area? Sure, but I want to have a solid career foundation first, and for my area of interest (nursing), I need college to do that. So, at least for now...I am just happy where I'm at. I'm safe, I'm well cared for, I have all of my needs and wants met, there are plenty of opportunities here for my major, and besides for capitalist America being capitalist America (live in the states whoops sorry for not saying that earlier), I am just...completely happy where I am at. 

Call me complacent, call me unambitious, I don't care. What if I don't want to ""stake it in the big city"" when I'm perfectly happy where I am?

2023-11-08,1699466018,My story about beating procrastination,"I graduated high school not too long ago and felt like life was lacking purpose. I didn't know what the future would be like and was struggling with getting into good daily routines. It was a vicious cycle of procrastination, feeling bad about it and procrastinating more.

I started browsing Reddit more and more and came across many communities dedicated to discipline and self-improvement including r/getdisciplined, r/NonZeroDay and r/theXeffect whose methods like the 5 second rule helped me a lot. Finally I managed to stick to a few small daily routines that improved my quality of life and helped me clear my head. My overall happiness was way up and I felt like I was on a good track towards fulfillment now. This was like nothing I had experienced before.

I still didn't know what to do with my life and so I decided I didn't want to go to university right after graduating. I learned programming in my school so I finally decided to create something.

Basically locking myself in my room for 3 months I managed to build something I am very proud of and learned a lot in the process. I realized that building or creating something is an inherently satisfying activity for me and that this is what I want to do.

Finally I'm at a point where I'm extremely happy to release this app, being satisfied with what I managed to create.

The concept of a NonZero day is ingrained in the app: No matter if you only work 3 minutes on your habits, as long as you actually work on them everyday you can check it off. Consistency trumps intensity in the long run.

What you can do with my App, Mainspring:

-Tick off your habits daily. I made sure that this process is as satisfying as possible :)

-Set a goal to your actions - from a daily goal to a yearly goal

-Track your action history and see when you last did something 

-Monthly and yearly analytics that show your progress with beautiful graphs

-Take notes to better remember what you did and how

-Streaks can motivate you to continue building your habits

-Break down tasks into grouped areas for maximum organization


The app is free with a premium version offering unlimited habits, home screen widgets, better customizations and advanced statistics :)

The app is still in heavy development as there are a ton of features I wish to include in the future, like reminders, or mood tracking.

My goal is to offer really deep insights on how your habits and mood influence each other. Along the lines of ""If you complete X habit in 3 hours, you have a 90% chance of being in a happy mood and completing your other habits too.""

I really hope this app helps some of you :) Please let me know all the constructive criticism and feedback that you have.

I work with 4 other students, one of which is Kate. Recently, Kate stopped working with our group. I asked her if everything was OK and she said it was so I didn't think much if it. Last week, we all finished and as a result I headed out along with the rest of my group. I left a few minutes before the rest of the group because I wasnt feeling great. Kate, who was working alone, wasnt finshed. We all left, breifly spoke in the hallway and headed out. Later that day, I said sorry for ditching workshop, I was really tired.

Today, Kate asked me to talk in the hallway alone. She if we were hanging out without her. I said no (we werent) and she said I hurt her feelings by not including her. She specifically that when I said sorry for leaving her, she felt beneath me and less than. I apologized and made it clear that I just wasn't feeling great and finished early along with the rest of the group. We only chatted in the hallway for a few moments before heading home. I also told her I noticed she had stopped working with our group which is why I asked her if everything was ok. On one hand, I feel bad since she felt excluded. On the other, she chose not to work with our group so why would I let her know I was leaving? When Kate was working with our group, I went out of my way to be friendly since she seems quiet so I'm really surprised she felt like I wasn't including her. Am I in the wrong? What should I do? She didn't seen to care that I said sorry and just replied with ""ok"". I'm so uncomfortable being around her now.

2023-11-08,1699463684,Advice? I am considering dropping out of college.,"So I'd like to be an editor for books and news articles. Or maybe even an social media manager. Just something that has to do with reading and writing. I'm 24 years old and currently in community college for a Liberal Arts degree because they do not offer English specific degrees. I don't know if all community colleges are like that or if it's just the one I'm attending, but it's frustrating how there are degrees focused on math and science but not English. :( My issue is that I am terrible at math; I have struggled with it since third grade and I must start at the bottom of the barrel and work my way up. So I have to take three more math classes after the basic math class that I'm in now to get to the class that actually counts towards graduation. Next, I need to take Intro to Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and then Math Applications. But I'm not even positive that I will pass basic math. I am doing well so far, thiugh. I am getting extra help and completing all the assignments on time, but I think we have at least one more test before the end of the semester and then the final. I bombed one of the tests and got a D on the first one. I did well on the take-home test but that's only because it was open book and I could use a calculator. I'm just thanking God we get unlimited time on the proctored tests at least. It seems that the tests do not bring down grades all that much at all, but I am worried about the final. And even if I do good in this class, I worry about the three other math classes that I'll need to take and that that those tests will not be so forgiving. I am also just frustrated that I have to take a bunch of math courses when I'm not even going to be doing math on my career path, just because I'm not eligible for applications! I'd be taking more math than English classes at this rate (I passed the two that I needed to do with flying colors) despite my career choice (which I've expressed to advisors that I wanted to do). So I'm thinking would it be better to just drop out and get a certificate in editing rather than taking a bunch of math classes when I could be learning more about grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation? It doesn't even seem like I can do the things I want to do until I aim for a BA. And I've read online that you can just skip an an associates degree and go for a BA. = I am interested in journalism as well, which I think is a huge aspect of getting a BA for writing from what I looked into, so I consider that as a potential career too. But the problem is potential math courses, once again. =.=¨For the certificate, I am considering UC Berkeley Global for online courses. Is it legitimate? What would be the best online courses for learning how to edit pieces of writing? But is that a good path though? Is it better to just stick with the community college despite feeling like I'm not going anywhere? Like, would it be worth it in the long run? Or should I go with aiming for a certificate in editing? Or maybe just focus on getting a BA? That is, if I can find a university that does not require me to do any math courses. =.=¨ Do those even exist? = Is it possible that the community college can offer me alternatives.

Ever since school I never had that perfect friend circle. I was usually a third wheel in most conversations and was never really appreciated but wanting friends too badly I never noticed the fact that I was surrounded with toxic people. Not giving any hate those people did make times bearable but I don't think I was that important to them as everyone else. When I was in high school I was going to an elite school where most the kids were from the royalty or the children of doctors, lawyers etc. I could go there because of my dad's hard earned savings. We are in upper middle class if you are wondering. I had a beat friend there although we got along she never wanted to hug me or even shake hands. I could put my hand on her shoulder etc and she would ditch me in lunch. But now I'm at this new college. With people of my mind set and I feel so much at home. These girls have made me happy and appreciated. The wait for me to pack my bags. Walk with me and include me. Today was a ceremony of our college. I recently took part in an essay competition and came first. When my name came up in the announcement no one else clapped other then the 12 girls whom I adore and they cheered so loud that I didn't need the other people to clap. I felt appreciated. Never before have I felt this way. They don't know know how much it meant to me. They tell me my smile is cute when I'm insecure about it and now I smile more. Moral of the story.

My project is submitted now and I have just remembered the other students project I looked at before and realised how truly similar they are. I did not mean to copy this other persons work concept wise or aesthetically. But I cant deny the similarity. 

Its been one week post submission, we had a big presentation and the grades are far from being released. Should I be worried? Would the teachers have brought this up already if they thought it was plagiarised? 

Additional comments: 

- In this project we also submitted our process of how we got to the final design (I havent seen the other students process so I cant imagine it is the same as mine)",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qkbtz/plagiarism_should_i_be_worried/

2023-11-08,1699439720,Should I take a gap year or change my course? Or continue?,"Hello, I hope no one recognizes me here. I am new to this app, but this is not a new account.

I am currently in third-year college, taking an Electrical Engineering course. Why did I take this? Because I have no choice. I am afraid of being left behind. I was also not lucky in my choice of courses. And this course was the only program open. I accepted it without thinking of what consequences I would face.

In the first year, I managed to pass it because the subjects were not focused on my course itself yet. Also, it was only online then.

And in the second year of the second sem, the school implemented face-to-face classes. I was not ready. But what else is my choice?
In the middle of the second semester, we joked that we had to change our course because it was difficult and we couldn't do it anymore. To me, I was joking, but I am actually thinking about it.

I didn't transfer until my third year of college. But now, I'm losing hope and want to take a gap year. I am starting to get scared. I know fear is normal to feel throughout college. But that kind of fear, I have no courage to face it.

I have multiple reasons why I did not follow my decision. First is my college friends. They are the reason why I was able to get myself here. I will regret leaving the memories we shared.

Second, I didn't think through my decision properly. Maybe because I didn't have enough time to look for a school. I am also thinking about the tuition fee in case I transfer. We have free tuition, by the way. So when you fail a subject, you will lose it, and you will have to pay for the tuition fee.

And maybe it's my pride that's why I can't transfer? I chose it with my own will. Then my parents almost let the whole world know about the course I took. From neighbors to relatives. What will they think when I stop studying?

When I joked to my parents that I was going to change course, they were surprised and angry. Not too angry. They said I should continue because the year is a waste, and I will graduate in just a few years. I still remember saying to them, ""Well, I can't do it anymore. What can you do about it?"" That is the truth. I cannot take it anymore. I have been pressured around me; Professors, subjects, acquaintances who graduated with honors, and society.

I am afraid of my course.

Also, I was having a bad day. I failed my midterm exam in one subject. I thought I was going to pass it, but I didn't. I got 9 out of 50. I answered everything, but there was something wrong with my solution.

Earlier, before the class started, our Professor explained something about solving and said it was an algorithm. I thought it wasn't me. But when I was thinking about getting the test paper, I got a hunch that Sir might be referring to me. 

It was embarrassing. It's like I'm the lowest of all.

Please, do not hate me. I just want to know your opinion and sincere advice.

Sorry if there were too many errors.

Also, please let me know if this post is against the rules here.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qiv4r/should_i_take_a_gap_year_or_change_my_course_or/
2023-11-08,1699436269,"I dont know if I should drop my course this semester, I have 3 days to decide.","Im taking finite math as an online course for my community college. I had a very poor grade on my recent exam, which exams are worth 80% of my grade. She said some of the problems I did on the exam were not done correctly in her specific way, and for that I just got a 0 for those problems and she is accusing me of using outside resources, which is prohibited. Im not gonna lie, yes I was cheating, but she doesnt know and I dont want her to know.

She said it herself she believed I used outside resources but she could not prove it. I tried telling her I wasnt and that the methods I was using were my own and that I wouldnt do that again, and use her specific method next time. She asked to meet with me on campus and now Im very worried. She has her own specific method for doing these problems. Im terrible at math and i regret even taking this course because I found out it isnt necessary for my major at DePaul, and it still counts as an elective. 

I have dropped many courses so far ever since starting college. I already dropped a course weeks ago, and if I drop this one this will be my 7th or 8th W. My major is MIS for DePaul. Two reasons I want to drop this course is 

1. Im being accused of cheating, and since this is all done on an online course she couldnt prove it, but now shes asking me to meet with her on campus after I responded to her saying that I did not use outside resources, but I will use her specific method next time which I wouldve done initially but didnt know she said she has her own method to do these problems and we all have to do them. She never said why she wants to meet with me on campus, i replied to her asking why and that I would reassure her Id use her specific method next time. She sucks at helping btw, she sucks at teaching and her modules and videos dont help much, she also takes forever to respond to her emails, and in general is unprofessional. People in my class complain about her. Once again yes I was cheating but she cant know that and I never knew she had a specific method we had to use to solve the problems. 

2. Assuming she no longer asks me to meet on campus, no longer suspects me, and that she can just forget this one time happened, which Im not very comfortable risking. My grade is now significantly lowered to a failing grade, and I do not know if I can pass the class now, Id have to do very well on the next exams and I do not know how to do her stupid specific methods. 

Last date to drop this course with a W is in 3 days. Im waiting for her next response and depending on her reasoning as to why she wants to meet with me on campus, and her suspecting levels, I may not drop the course. I also dont know if she contacts the academics team and suspects me for cheating, resulting in academic dishonesty and that would screw me over completely. 

I agree that dropping the course makes me look a little bit guilty but I could also just use the excuse that Im failing and have very bad anxiety and depression. Im not sure shell even care to go that far to try and prove I was cheating, which she cant prove, considering she doesnt care about responding to her students even. I have ADHD, Im terrible at math and a little dumb in general sometimes, which was why I cheated, and Im sure theres other students in my class who cheated too, Im just getting screwed. Not saying what I did was right, I had to cheat because Im dumb. I used ChatGPT, mathway and chegg to solve the problems. I kind of have to rely off of them, and if I knew her specific method I wouldve had ChatGPT do it for me. Now I feel like if I do well on the next exams shell assume Im cheating. And her asking to meet with me on campus, with 0 explanation, is driving me crazy.

2023-11-08,1699433502,"If literally 99% of students won't go into research for some fields (computer science, Electrical engineering, ...) why does teaching focus so much on research?","Some programmes focus heavily on research. I was wondering why that was the case considering that most students won't become researchers. Wouldn't there be a better way to both target (potential) future researchers and people who will go into industry? Like for example, two slightly different study tracks or something?

Another consequent question is why does academia still stick to a model that neither satisfies teachers (who are researchers) nor students (who genuinely need good teachers). It seems that the equation makes life miserable for teachers who'd prefer spending their time researching and students who eventually face grumpy (perhaps rightly so) human beings.

It's a probably naive question from the standpoint of someone who knows the inner workings of academia but I was genuinely curious.

An argument that I see rather often is that if that system has worked well so far why change it? To what I would beg to differ. While it has worked well that doesn't exclude the possibility that it can be improved. But again what do I know haha

It is also empirically true that many job offers require some university degree (sometimes even master's or PhD) but we've seen these requirements change over the years especially in the US where access to education is becoming more and more financially difficult. Thus, this sole metric cannot be taken as a proxy value for college relevance. The job market and its requirements will always adapt to the supply. That's also why we see more and more jobs that used to not require any college degree now require one.

Anyway my two cents. What are your take or insight on the matter? Genuinely curious (especially from an academic perspective)",college,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qhhtf/if_literally_99_of_students_wont_go_into_research/

Idk these people personally but it gets so bad to the point where u can tell these girls are clearly uncomfortable working with him, Im pretty sure I saw one of them either cry or she was just working with tears in her eyes. 

Im not sure how involved the teaching staff is because it seems that the girls go to them with these concerns but I havent seen much action.

2023-11-08,1699420654,Is it worth it to take a gap year to get into a better university?,"
So I messed up big time and am suffering from immense regret right now.

I chose the wrong university (University of Toronto) because of stupid reasons and regret it so much now. The other university (University of Waterloo) was just better in every aspect for my major(Computer Engineering) and I definitely would be more successful graduating from there than from my current uni. But I made a very immature choice, listened to the wrong people and now I'm here. The regret is so intense that it's making me perform terrible in my exams/midterms because I keep beating myself up for messing up so much. I don't think I can move on.

I am thinking of dropping out from my current uni and reapplying as a freshman to UofWaterloo because I want to get in so bad. Also, they don't really accept transfers and even when they do, the faculty of engineering does not allow for transfer of credits, so I'll have to restart from year 1. My only option is now to drop out and reapply as a freshman.

But there's one problem. I'll lose out on a year.... One year is fine with me but the thing is I've already taken a gap year before beginning university so technically I'll be 2 years behind if I decide to drop out. So I'm not sure if it's worth it or not at this point considering how good UWaterloo engineering is.

Thankfully, money is not really an issue but if I drop out now and take a gap year, I won't have to pay the next semester's tuition fee and that will save me a ton of money especially since I'm an international student.

I'm really lost and confused. Can anyone please help and advise me?",college,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17qeldx/is_it_worth_it_to_take_a_gap_year_to_get_into_a/
