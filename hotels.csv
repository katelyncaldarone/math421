Please tell me the brand you or your hotel uses, and where I could find it.  

Also if you know another sub I can post this in for suggestions, please let me know, the bedding sub is pretty much inactive.

Similarly, do not write your room number on your room key card. This is why the front desk gives you a key card cover. That small piece of plastic is so easy to lose (happens daily at my hotel). Plus, the writing doesnt come off, so we cant reuse the key (theyre pretty expensive =,). If you lose your key on the street, you basically just gave a stranger access to you and your stuff. 

Hotel training (in my experience and study) tells the employee not to say the room number out loud to protect the guest. If you come to the desk with an issue with your room, theyre supposed to ask for your name and look up your room number in the computer.

2023-01-30,1675039650,Opened my door to find someone in my room... or was I the one who walked into *their* room?,"Riddle me this: yesterday, when I opened the room to my hotel door with my electronic key, there were already people inside. How did that happen? How could we both have keys to the same room?

The moment I opened the door, I saw a young woman pacing and talking on her phone. I said ""Oh, sorry!"" and shut the door. A young man opened it a moment later to find out what was going on; he seemed as confused as I was. I told him I'd go back to reception to find out was going on.

Now, check-in had already been a bit rough, with a long line; every single person checking in seemed to have some kind of problem. Or perhaps the computers were just running slow? Anyway, I'd changed the date of my stay, so I'd already been through one round with staff trying to find our reservation.

The staff double-checked my ID and that I had the right room, then asked me to wait in the lobby while they went upstairs to check who was in my room. (As usual for this particular luxury hotel, only one lift was working for the entire building.)

The young couple had vanished! The room was empty! The staff probably figured I wasn't going back to that room in a hurry, so they moved me to a different one. I'm there now, with the deadbolt on the door.

A bug in the booking system? In the electronic key system? Ghosts? How did two sets of guests end up with the keys to the same room? That's not just inconvenient, it could be dangerous. I've googled a little without being able to find a straightforward explanation, though I suspect the staff know what happened and weren't in a big hurry to tell me! Any hotel staff have a likely explanation?

They charged my credit card the cost of the full stay up front, but the booking confirmation explicitly states that reservations cancelled more then 1 week in advance are refunded in full. Seems reasonable, but here's the catch. There's no way to cancel the reservation. 

They have an email address to direct such requests, but the inbox seems unmonitored. My first cancellation request in March still has no reply, much less the subsequent ones I've sent. They also have a front desk/customer service phone number, but there has not been a single time someone answered the phone in the past month. I've left voicemails with callback numbers, but like the emails, they are never returned. 

This hotel appears to actually exist from what I can tell, but seems to simply not have staff monitoring their phones or emails. 

Assuming this trend continues up to my booking date, do I have any recourse? Is there any alternative path to getting my money back or am I just realistically out $1,000? Curious if anyone has ever found themselves in a similar position.

With the membership, you are granted a discount on food, the rate depends on how many people you are with. If you are 2 people, you'll get 50% off which is great.

There are Black Out dates, where you won't get the benefits, such as Christmas, Valentines day (!!!), Mothers Day etc.

We booked non-refundable hotels because our first date we planned to go, we got turned around midair because a problem with the plane so we thought to ourselves ""What could go wrong this time?"" 

Obviously attending the wake and funeral is most important to our family and if it has to happen that we lose our money, so be it, but we also would like to know the best way to go about things. Do we cancel? Do we reschedule? Is rescheduling even a thing? 

Thank you all so much for your help. It complicates things due to it being abroad so we're completely lost on what to do!

2023-04-16,1681649606,Why do hotels not have kitchen and personal laundry?,"If hotels had a small apartment like feel, kitchen , personal laundry, I wouldn't use VRBO or Airbnb.

Why has this not become a thing? I'm sure high end hotels do, but for the average person who wants to spend a little more than the hotel cost, it's.not. 

It doesn't have to be fully stocked even. One pot, one pan. A fridge to store cold food. A washer and dryer to clean clothes. I could bring everything else like utensils, plates, cups, coffee maker even, etc. 

I was comparing prices of hotels and VRBO and they were almost identical. I figure at least with VRBO we have a kitchen to cook and laundry for simplicity cleaning. The kitchen alone saves me hundreds by cooking my own food. The only. Extra cost for going with VRBO was the VRBO price over the host cost which was the same as a hotel. So of course I'm paying th VRBO cost just to have a kitchen and laundry.

But I personally don't like staying at individual people's houses. I would prefer a large company like a hotel.",hotels,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/12o7jfn/why_do_hotels_not_have_kitchen_and_personal/
2023-04-16,1681627040,Am I wrong to be upset?,"So staying at a Marriott property (ambassador/ titanium levels) for work. Sister is also here (why the 2 different tiers).
Anyways this is an extended stay type hotel we have rooms next to each other very convenient for us. This is where the positives end.
On the 3rd floor elevator doesn't work so have to climb 3 flights of starts several times a day. Annoying but what ever. I called and ask for my room to be cleaned (after 7 days of it not being cleaned) wasn't cleaned, called again was told if would be on the list for today. 

Again its a work trip which includes working on the weekend so I am literally gone all day (usually getting back to the room after 11pm)  today no exception.  My sister really has to pee and can't do the stairs so I drop her at the lobby and go to drag my backpack, tools and food up the stairs. Wall down the hall and as I get closer to my room I see that my door is propped open. I was confused since my sister is in the lobby its not her in my room. I stupidly walk into my room and look around and its clear my room was finally cleaned, but left unsecured all day. 

Panicking I call my sister as I stay taking inventory of my electronics (I am in It I have TONS) and call my sister and ask if she still is in the lobby. She is, I tell her what happens she tells the front desk and I could feel the lack of empathy through the phone. They kept implying I needed to come to the front desk (for what?) My sister explains to them thats not happening as I still search around my room (2 bedroom suite) making sure my retail purchase and electronics are present and accounted for (they are as far as I can tell) then I notice my fridge was left cracked and everything inside is warm. All the food I had in there has to be tossed now.. My room temp was adjusted 6 degrees down from where I had it (I like a warm room and it was a meat locker to me). I am relaying this to my sister and again I can hear the lack of empathy through the phone. 

They gave my sister the managers card and want me to talk to her tomorrow (of course during the time I will be working) and thats basically it.

I am fairly easy going and understand how stressful work can be and can emphasize with housekeeping making a mistake. I dont want her fired or anything mistakes happen but seriously act like you give a shit. My whole room could have been wiped out. Several thousand in electronics, new clothes (present I bought on my rare day off Easter) and my own clothes and what not.
I dont think I am out of line for being upset and annoyed.

Can someone advise me on how to proceed with the hotel tomorrow to rectify this? I feel this is a major breach in my security and trust and its not sitting right with me the dismissive attitude.",hotels,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/12nyhh3/am_i_wrong_to_be_upset/

2023-04-13,1681411637,Monitoring r/hotels More Actively &amp; Community Planning,"Hello everyone!  So let me start by saying, I apologize for not really maintaining the community like a moderator should.  Honestly, I haven't been Redditing like I use to and with the tool changes, it's been a little confusing for me.  I think I have all that squared away now.

**Minor Change / Could have major impact on** r/hotels

The first change I made today was removed the seasoning requirement for accounts.  We previously had it so that your account needed to be 7 days old &amp; have 25+ comment karma to make a post/comment on a post.  This change was put in place when I first became a moderator because of the excessive amount of spam.  Bots would literally post 20+ times a day about a $13 hotel room in BFE advertising random motels around the world.  I also get a lot of messages though from legitimate people trying to make posts that wouldn't go through though.  I'm hoping that Reddit's bot detection has improved immensely over the past half decade, but if I see an uptick in spam postings, we will revisit this subject.

**More Active Monitoring**

Since I will be checking in multiple times a day, it does make reporting comments &amp; posts more important.  If you see anything that looks like spam, is inappropriate in content, or whatever else, please make a report on it.  I will review that and delete comments/posts that violate the terms that don't exist here (yet).

**Taking Community Suggestions**

While the community kindda just runs itself and polices itself very well here, I'd love to take any community suggestions and hear what you guys think would make the community better.  I'd love to know who makes up our community in general.  Are you a hotel manager, worker, frequent guest?  Do you just love hotels in general and know a lot about them?  Are you here just because you want to ask a question regarding a recent stay you had?  Comment below and let us know!  


If you have any suggestions on improvement, commenting on this post is a great idea so people can vote on changes they want to see, or feel free to message me/us directly using the mod mail tool.  I'd love to check any input!

2023-04-12,1681339868,I think I just got a virtually free hotel stay,"So& I booked a stay through Priceline in February for April 8-12. When I booked, I was informed that all hotel fees were included in the total balance ($1500) and that I would pay at the hotel property (all normal).

Fast forward to the April 8th, I check in at 1230 am, upon check in Im told there is a $200 security deposit, I say okay and have them run my debit card that is one file. While were going through the check in procedure I ask if I should pay the balance of the hotel stay ($1500) now or if I do that at check out. The person working the front desk tells me I pay the balance once I check out (all normal).

On April 10th during my hotel stay I see the hotel charged me the $200 security deposit but also a $286 charge was deducted from the hotel as well. So I went down to the front desk and asked what the $286 charge was for and the person I spoke with told me that there was a mistake and that when I checkout, both the $200 and $286 charges would be put back into my account within 10 business days BUT THEN proceeded to say that our trip was PREPAID(no it wasnt). So I just said okay and proceeded with my day. 

So yesterday I go down to the desk and try and find out what exactly the $286 charge was for because I was genuinely curious, and again I was told my stay was prepaid and that the two charges would be returned to my checking account once I check out&.. so at that point my gears start turning and Im wondering why the hotel is saying my stay has been prepaid when I havent paid the initial $1500 yet. I chalked it up to being a mistake and figured today it would be updated and Id be paying the full $1500 once I checked out. But alas, I checked out and was only was charged $280 for things I charged to the room and hotel fees that were initially included in the $1500 that was due. 

Now Im left wondering what exactly happened here, who messed up and if theyll eventually figure it out and charge me&. but for now, I just stayed in a hotel for 4 nights and paid $280 for the entire stay.

***TLDR: Overcharged by the Millenium Biltmore Los Angeles, No Invoice Sent, and attempts to contact them have been met with radio silence. Could use advice on the next actions I should take.***

I stayed at the Millenium Biltmore Los Angeles during Wrestlemania Weekend (a little over a week ago), the pro-wrestling equivalent to the Superbowl. There was a third-party convention called WrestleCon that used that hotel for their wrestling convention and provided a special rate for people to stay in that hotel.

The deal was $230/night. I stayed for five nights. Daily Facility Use Fee ($25) was negotiated by the convention to be removed. The gist is that I was overcharged by $85+. I cross-compared with someone who stayed the same nights/room as me and it was different. $1480 (Me) vs $1395 (Internet Friend). Furthermore, the reservation email that had the total price (Room Fee + Taxes/Fees, with no detailed breakdown) I got prior was entirely different ($1339) from what my credit card bank charge was. I felt like there were discrepancies and that I was not charged the special rate that WrestleCon had.

* **I got no invoice** post-check out despite getting emails from them asking how my stay was. I wouldn't know what the breakdown is. I can't see online since my reservation number doesn't work anymore and trying to get one via phone call leads to voicemail where I was told to sent an email.
* I tried calling last weekend and was sent to the ""manager on duty"" voicemail where I left a message with my complaint and phone number. I was told that their finance/accounting department only operates on business days (Mon-Fri, 9AM-5PM PST). The finance/accounting department line had an automated voicemail with an email address to send along with my last 4 credit card digits, my name, and my stay dates.
* **I sent an email last Saturday** with screenshots and information that has not been replied to.
* **I called today** and despite it being ""during"" business hours, no one from the finance/accounting team answered.
* I got through to an operator and was **redirected to a manager line where it was a voicemail again**.

He said, ""Yes, unfortunately!"" What was so unfortunate about living in the same hotel that he manages?","I asked the AskAI ChatGPT app. Its answer:

---

It's difficult to know for sure what the hotel general manager meant without more context and information. However, there could be several reasons why he might have said ""Yes, unfortunately"" in response to your question about living where he works.

Firstly, managing a hotel can be a very demanding job, with long hours and a lot of responsibility. Living on-site means that the general manager is always ""on call"" and never really gets a break from work. This lack of separation between work and personal life can be challenging and may lead to feelings of burnout or stress.

Secondly, living in the same hotel as the guests and staff can be challenging in terms of privacy and personal space. As the general manager, he may feel like he can never truly relax or be himself, as he is always representing the hotel and its brand. Additionally, living in close proximity to guests and staff can make it difficult to maintain boundaries and separate his personal life from his professional responsibilities.

Overall, it's possible that the hotel general manager was simply expressing frustration with the challenges of living and working in the same place, rather than indicating any specific reason why it was unfortunate.",hotels,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/12i946t/when_i_delivered_a_meal_to_a_hotel_guest_at_the/

Do you care about relations with the hotels? Meaning famous people, famous places and events nearby?

Is there anything in particular you want to know about the hotel, before you go there?

Do you ever use the social media to contact the hotel staff?

Do you like when they are very active, or just a few posts a year are fine?

The man literally raised his nose at us like a stereotypical snooty person in cartoons. we said it would be about an hour and he said ok you can have the hour to wait, he then proceeded to stand outside the glass and stare at us the whole time my mom called the friend who was supposed to be giving us the ride and he came in less then 10 minutes later asking if we were leaving yet after he said we could have the hour to leave. so as an overall recap. they have bed bugs,the staff are snooty as hell, dont go its alright if you wanna gamble and get small pizza's they call large for 40 dollars i am including pictures of the bed bugs in the review

2023-03-28,1679994880,"NEVER USE THIRD PARTY SITES - And I always do, and I've been happy with them","In this sub-reddit, in person with other travelers, and when speaking to hotel employees I've very often been told to ""just call the hotel directly"". The reasons I've been given are that the hotel will give you the best deals, the third party site does not guarantee you the room type, the third party site can't help you.

Cancellation or rescheduling - I would agree that the third party site cannot help you, or will not once the booking is made. You can't get there, you have to reschedule, whatever it is, nothing, even buying trip insurance when offered you basically have to provide a doctors note type of thing. I have been in a few situations where I've had to re-book and called the hotels directly and they graciously moved the booking without involving the third party, that is of course at their discretion and they're under no obligation to do so.

Cost - I have booked through third party sites for over a decade and there's been times where I've found a hotel I like, called the hotel and told them that I'd rather book through them if I can get the same rate I'd booked previously through the third party site previously that I'd book directly through the hotel, only to be declined. I'd then use the third party site again, and could again get the lower rate. My understanding is the hotel sets the parameters of what they can accept on the third party site and only gets a small percentage of what the customer pays so it's difficult for me to understand the logic in turning down a customer who's offering to pay direct when they'd allowed a third party to pay them so much less. I'm always paying less than what's listed on the hotel site by a fair amount.

Room Selection - I'm finding sites like Priceline allow you to choose a room type, like ""single king,  accessible, double queen, suite, etc"". Even with the booking blind options which often give you the lowest price like ""your hotel will be something like Ramada"" etc. If I'm traveling alone I'll usually choose a single King as I'm getting  a big bed and often more furniture like a dinette and armchair. But even then, I'm not affected if there's more beds than I need.

What am I missing about third party sites? I've got a decade now of positive experiences, but there must be some legitimately solid reasons that people tend to shy away from them.",hotels,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/124iuqf/never_use_third_party_sites_and_i_always_do_and/

The remaining options in the phone tree and online do not allow you to actually do anything except book a new reservation or comment on a reservation that has been fulfilled.

I'm calling the hotel, but does anyone have any tips on how to actually get this refund?

EDIT: I have attempted to contact the hotel, but one guy found my reservation, and another lady did not. Annoyingly since I'm not in the country of my stay I'm dealing with a language barrier and international calling fees too. Either way, my stay does not appear to be canceled. I have found a couple email addresses from the Australian side of their website, so I'm hoping to get results back that way.

I guess this confirms one thing: If your plans can in any way change, do not book Choice Hotels until your plans become concrete. The onus to deal with this problem seems to be on the hotel directly, and not with the larger chain. The chain also does not give you any real avenues to peruse a remedy until AFTER your stay has ended.

2023-03-14,1678763009,"Double booking + egregious hotel cancellation policy! HELP, what can I do?","I made a huge mistake booking a hotel for an upcoming trip to Tokyo with my two kids. I made a reservation on [booking.com](https://booking.com) for a total of about $3000 for 6 nights in a large chain hotel, which is more than I could afford, but our dates are in high season and almost everything was sold out when I started looking in January. The hotel offered free cancellation until March 3, so I felt safe in having a backup while I looked for something cheaper. Soon after I did find something cheaper, less than $1500 for the same 6 nights, in the same hotel in the same type of room, but on a different travel website. That also offered free cancellation, so I went ahead and booked it. 

Here comes my grave mistake: my son got covid and then I caught it from him and we were both sick and I forgot to cancel the first reservation during the free cancellation period. Today I went on [booking.com](https://booking.com) to do so, and was informed that the cancellation fee is the full price of the trip, i.e. $3000. I asked for them to waive the fee, thinking that it's 3 weeks out, and it's high season so they'll have no problem rebooking the room. They said no. I have the option to cancel the reservation and be charged the entire fee, or to keep the reservation.

I am a single mom who saved up and pinched pennies to be able to take my kids on this trip that we have all dreamed of, so it's not like I can say ""Oh well, I'll cancel the second reservation and just pay an extra $1400 for the exact same room booked on the first reservation."" 

The way I see it, I have two options to try to avoid paying for the more expensive reservation:

1. I cancel the credit card I used for the [booking.com](https://booking.com) reservation, and then cancel the booking and ignore it when they ask for a new card after the charge is declined. Then I show up at the same hotel on the same reservation date and try to check in under the other booking, hoping they haven't made the connection to the failed cancellation.
2. I don't cancel the first booking and just show up at the hotel and try to check in under the second booking, that is already paid for BTW. But will they see two bookings and not allow me to do this, and they will force me to pay for both rooms, or cancel the second booking and keep the money?

I feel angry at myself for not reading the small print when I booked the ""free cancellation/pay when you arrive at the hotel"" room on [booking.com](https://booking.com). I don't travel much and I had absolutely no idea that a hotel would charge me for the full stay when a room is canceled so far in advance. (And, for reasons I cannot understand, the hotel's cancellation policy on the second travel website is a fee of 1 night's charge!) I'm in such a bind now, and I'm going to be losing a lot of sleep over this unless I find a solution.

My husband and I are on our honeymoon in Mexico. We booked with an IOH hotel as part of our road trip - made the booking direct and well in advance. The hotel isnt luxury but isnt cheap either. We had an extremely long journey and arrived at 1pm - tried to check in, sorry check in is from 3pm - no bother at all, Im used to being able to check in early in the UK but rules are rules. 

We went out, came back at 3.02pm. Sorry, we dont currently have a room available, you can have another room thatll have two beds (ie twin room), or you can wait. Its our honeymoon so we dont want separate beds and agreed to wait. 

Waited for an hour in the lobby to no avail. Went back to the desk at 4pm - sorry we still have no room, I can move you to a room without a bath and just a shower - by that point Im exhausted and wed been out in sweltering heat for much of the day so I say sure, go for it. Staff at reception says ok, give me 2 minutes. 10 more minutes pass, I look over and nothing is happening at the desk. I come over again - sorry the system isnt currently letting me move the room so you have to wait a bit longer. 

At this point Im so desperate for a shower and a bed that I just want to know if and when Im going to be able to get to the room. I ask if they could please tell me, and if it is any longer than 10-15 minutes more Id rather they cancelled and we just go to a different hotel. They cant really give an answer. Both sides have a bit of a language barrier which is tricky, so we ask if it was possible to speak to the manager or someone else - politely - to see if we can figure it out with them. The manager is not available. At this stage I just say ok - understand its not your fault but please could you just cancel the reservation and we will go somewhere else. 

The guy at the desk says I have to cancel it myself on the website - I explain that if I do that I get charged a cancellation fee for one night which doesnt feel very fair. In the end second staff at reception who wasnt involved up to this point just says well cancel it for you and we went somewhere else - both staff seemed pretty aggravated with us. 

For context, reception was completely empty. There was only one more gentleman ahead of us who also got told he can have a room with two beds which he opted for. Not seen a single other soul checking in in the time we were there. Husband and I were frustrated between ourselves but polite to hotel staff. 

Am I the asshole? What else could I have done beyond waiting an unspecified amount of time? Under different circumstances I probably would have given it another hour or so but we were both exhausted and just desperate to get in somewhere.

Edited to add: hotel very highly rated across a number of review platforms.

This is the first time I've stayed at a hotel by myself; usually its with family, generally my mom, who's very assertive. So I've never had to deal with this kind of situation, and usually in these kinds of situations where the experience wasn't great, I just look on the bright side and move on, maybe let them know but make no demands or anything.

This though. This was insane.

The front desk lady was lovely, and I was able to get a reservation on short notice following some car trouble. Its not a classy, fancy hotel by any means, but the bed was so uncomfortable that I literally slept on the loveseat provided instead. 

I got virtually no sleep, and my attempt to sleep on the bed left me with some serious back pain. Not only that, but at 3:00 am I was woken up by a domestic in another room that was so loud and dramatic that in the moment, I thought it was someone watching TV too loudly. Until I heard police come and bang on their door. Didn't hear anything after that.

Is this refund, partial or otherwise, territory? And if so, how do I request it respectfully, given that the workers here did nothing wrong?",hotels,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/11bn8u2/canshould_i_ask_for_a_refund/

Diamond member with Hilton. 
Recently stayed over two weeks hotel hopping within the Hilton brand and at the end of the trip I only got about 50k points. Decided to look at a stay for a 1 nighter and the minimum for that location was 60k.  A bit pissed after thousands of dollars and couldn't even get a single weekday night in a mid sized city downtown.

So Im thinking of changing loyalty programs.
Only other hotels I tried was Marriott and ihg and best western and they seem pretty much the same. 

What would be the good program for obtaining more nights?
Of course I would like it to be a popular chain for safety/cleanliness and multiple locations.

 Ex. Hyatt has a good program but sadly around me there is 1 hotel in my city and surrounding cities might have 0-1. But Hilton has 3-4 per city.

As of this moment I'm leaning toward ihg. Multiple locations everywhere and I did research over a year ago and remember that after about a week stay you can accrue points to be worth 1 nights stay in any mid sized city.",hotels,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1156kgi/best_program_for_more_night/

So we did under her name and corporate discount. Then February 26th, I go into to pay, even though its a monthly they make us pay weekly, the manager messes around for a while with the computer. Then tells me the amount, same as expect, charged my card, then asked for my wifes name so he could add her to the reservation. What? Its under her name! I told him this , hes like you have only been here a couple of weeks we dont have any long term stays for you here. I assured him I did and that I didnt want to lose the resident discount, no taxes after 30 days. He said it wouldnt renew it its fine and that her discount still applies. I left, he doesnt seem like the type that can say or make errors if you know what I mean, so thats why. A few weeks ago we asked for the copy of the folio since the prices went from around 641 to 741, then 895, then 919. Last week was 919. We pay Fridays now. So tomorrow we @$139.99 a night&. Thats insane! We thought. We go back online, $91.99 plus tax a month, from tomorrow the 2nd to July 8th, almost $2100 less. Contacted customer support first. When they said that they might of had a rate increase and checked, he saw the $91.99 and said he was escalating to upper management. He advised to go up front and ask for them to cancel the reservation and renew without penalty. I told him how I felt about the manager. I also said I need them to contact us asap since we have to renew tomorrow. I dont wanna any issues. We have children with us and we dont want to have to move out etc& 

I went upfront to request a physical copy of the folio. There was a new person from another hotel, a lent employee, they printed and I asked them if they can answer a pricing issue I had. They said yes and as soon as I stated the difference in pricing, he came out to discuss. Basically, he has no idea and control of the prices, it doesnt automatically adjust, he has to contact his sales guy. If I want I can pay the same high rate tomorrow or he can cancel it tomorrow and I can start a new one. 

I guess I wait on corporate? Any hopes there? I have to be owed that over pay right?

2023-06-01,1685589186,The review ya always wanted to post after knowing the industry....,"Why am I not surprised that some people would actually complain about a $50 dollar room when the avg ADR (price) for a room near or in San Antonio is easily near $100 to $150+ if you're lucky?
Talk about noob travelers!
It's ridiculous... =

This place is a great deal in my opinion!!!


**And now for the TLDR when it comes to social media gremlins any hotel can relate to....**

Who's writing these review's anyway? I don't see decent actual working class people complaining over a $50 buck room.... Is it the disgruntled wife who's husband wasn't man enough to tell her, ""Sorry hun, this is all we can afford since we're going to Schlitterbahn, 6 Flags, Sea World, and the Alamo with you plus our 4+ kids we didn't even tell the hotel about SO we could get a cheeper rate/stay...""(?)

(...and WE wonder why hotels in New York City will take ""guaranteed"" government money by housing illegal immigrants and construction workers over wedding parties and normal travelers... Hmmm..... >)

...And then THEY wonder and complain when hotels don't know how much breakfast food hotels should pre-order and prepare in the morning? That's ridiculous! = Oh, and of course it's the ""hotels' fault"" in their eyes... even though they neglected their own family by not disclosing their needs to the hotel. Probably not by choice but hubby is trying to save money and save face in front of their family. (I get it... The Griswolds did it too...d) Meanwhile the WITCHES lay down their social media text spells while hubby is thinking, ""Yay, She's not mad at me!"" >s
Am I not Right?!  =>#=>#=
....By the way, ya married a dimwit...
Congratulations. =M
(That goes both ways btw...)

From what I've seen, this place is pretty good for $50 bucks... It's not like you're gonna be getting much more out of a hotel than a 4 hour nap between the kids finally going to bed after a long drive they probably slept through anyway (thanks to all the Benadryl and Dramamine ya had to give them) and then trying to get showers in the morning before starting your vacation day. =

Sure, a hotel could expect these dumbest people/guests ya can imagine and multiply that by the number of rooms the hotel has... but since Obama's 2008 crash and especially after the COVID crap, affording decent staff who have had quantive years in the hotel industry is hard to come by. Hotel management (including front desk managers) used to get 401Ks, but not since Obama... and probably never again. Apparently that's still the hotels' fault. = Yeah right.. Simpleton rule of thumb, ""If ya can't afford it, don't expect it.""

Of course people could always not be cheap nor neglect their families' lives... Ya know, like actually claim how many people &amp; pets will be in the room incase of an evacuation, give corporate a reason to raise wages for decenty trained employees, and at very least let the breakfast servers know how many people to expect and feed...... but of course that's ""the hotels' fault"" for --YOU-- being so cheep on your own ""family"" and not caring about your own kids' well being and lives... Daft families who don't prepare never seem to blame themselves.
No big surprise there!
*Sigh*

These people paid $50 bucks for a room, ignored their families needs, and expected a Ferrari that acts like a Winnebago. They don't actually care about their family, the people who actually work there, nor their fellow guests who may now have to go somewhere else for breakfast now. On top of that they want retribution in comps.... And yelp style bitch-craft complaining is all they ""socially"" know because they don't know how to confront people like a decent human being.
It's Friggin Ridiculous =D

To be fair I'm sure the issue is as old as the industry itself... But I bet some just probably want their $50 dollars back and think they can take advantage of some lowly hotel because they forgot ya have to pay for parking downtown and Biden's gas/inflation prices are another WTF on top of that... I dig being poor and cutting corners myself.

About 5 days after getting that confirmation email, I got another email saying that *I* had cancelled my reservation, and theyre sorry I did so. Confused, I called them. They said my payment didnt go through since it was a gift card and they sent me an email to ask for updated payment information a few days after booking.

Problem is, I didnt get that email - in my spam or otherwise. I was thankfully able to rebook at the same rate, but the situation didnt sit well with me. They had my phone number, why didnt they just call me before sending me an email that my reservation was cancelled BY me? 

I wrote some feedback to the hotel just so they were aware I never got the email in case this is an issue for other people. I was just lucky enough that my reservation was far enough away that I could rebook at the same rate. After about a week I got a response saying:

It doesnt matter if I have room available as ready. Typically they finish this about 2 hours before normal check in and then I can do early ones. The recent trend has been for people showing up at 1pm or noon the check in and being insulted when I tell them I can not do it.

Hotels.com only has a chat service. Nobody you can talk to explain things. So I explain my situation and they dont understand it. Literally saying things that are irrelevant. You were charged because there were 3 people. Nope, not for the second room. You were charged because children are considered adults for the reservation.  I get that. Not what Im angry about. We cant contact the hotel to talk about this. Im sorry. Seriously, thats my issue?  Im supposed to absorb the cost because you cant contact a 4 star hotel? Their most legitimate claim is prices are listed by the hotel on our website. Thats true, but I contacted hotels.com about the error in pricing. It clearly details and itemizes the cost of the extra person. This is a legitimate overcharge. I talked to the hotel. They agree I shouldnt be charged for the third person but they have no view into hotels.coms pricing. 

Moreover, I contacted them before I stayed there. The representative actually recommended that I stay and then fight the charge after my stay saying there was nothing the representative could do before the stay. Now Im stuck with no recourse.

2023-07-07,1688771747,Widow Spiders,"Been staying on and off at an hotel in NC for a year.

I brought here a lot of my employees, having sometimes 15 people at the same time for 4 weeks or more.

Service level has been steadily declining, but we were hanging in there because it was a fairly new hotel and was very close to our facility.

In May I saw a widow spider (brown probably) in the stairs. Told the employee at the counter, then left for a few weeks.

Coming back to the hotel I go check on the spider and it's still there, with 10 egg sacs in tow.

I tell the counter again, showing the photos and explaining the location and then proceed to send an e-mail to the manager, asking to have pest control remove spider and eggs.

Manager does not answer to my mails and no one seems to care, what are my options in this situation? I would prefer to stay in this hotel because I would not want to drive 30 miles every morning and evening, but honestly I don't like the idea of sharing the hotel with thousands of widow spiders",hotels,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/14tmr0j/widow_spiders/

A question to hotel managers.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels the last year or so, some very nice, some not so.  Without fail, there is a fault in every room.  Not big stuff, but annoying little things like blown light bulbs, dripping showers, squeaky door hinges, no batteries in the TV remote, etc.

How do these normally get dealt with?  They can't be housekeeping jobs, they don't have the time.  There can't be a maintenance team going around to check things as this would be too expensive.  So, is the operating model really just to depend on guests to report these faults when they find them?

2023-07-04,1688455382,9 Hotel revenue management strategies,"Here are some helpful examples and explanations below to help you better understand the many ways you can manage your hotel revenue. You can improve your financial outlook with each of these strategies and revenue management action plan.  
  
**1. Understand the Industry**  
Putting in a significant market focus is a vital revenue management tactic for hotels. Who exactly are you trying to reach? Where do they call home base? What do you think they want, need, and expect from you? How fierce is the opposition, exactly? In what ways could local variables affect demand over time? How does seasonality affect demand? Acquiring market knowledge is crucial for prudent decision-making when using effective revenue management tactics.  
  
**2. Optimization of market segments and prices**  
The answer to the question ""What is revenue management?"" should include discussion of price optimization. One strategy for doing so is called ""segmentation,"" in which your customer base is broken down into several ""types,"" their preferences and booking patterns are analyzed, and the prices they pay are optimized. You might, for example, offer discounted room rates to business travelers on the assumption that they will use other hotel services to make up the difference.  
  
**3. Align your various departments**  
One of the main steps is to think about how you can get the different hotel departments to work together and coordinate to implement your hotel revenue strategy. To accomplish this, you'll need to educate the department heads on the value of hotel revenue management and win them over. Help them fine-tune their methods if they need it, and make sure their documentation is accurate.  
  
**4. Find the most appropriate pricing method**  
Choosing the best pricing strategy at any given time is the key to good hotel revenue management. Hotels can make more money by charging more during peak seasons when occupancy rates are high, while in off-seasons, a discount pricing plan can help them sell rooms that might otherwise go unsold. Make sure your hotel revenue strategy makes sense and that you have room to maneuver.  
  
**5. Offering rewards for direct reservations**  
Answer to how to increase hotel revenue is to offer direct bookings. Hotel revenue management can benefit greatly from direct reservations because hotels keep all the money customers pay throughout the booking process. However, while OTAs do increase a hotel's exposure to potential guests, they also require a commission from each booking made through their site. So, you should offer perks like a loyalty program, free add-ons, and so on to encourage direct bookings.

When I was hourly, I calculated my OT passed 5 hours was noticeable on my paycheck so for years, this didnt bother me. Once a new manager came in, I was told in order to stay under 40 hours, I needed to call on the last day of my work week and adjust my start time so I didnt hit 40 hours.

The first evening I heard a burbling noise and smelled sewer gas (hydrogen sulfide) -- there was brown water bubbling up in the bathroom sink.  It stank.  I went to the front desk, they sent maintenance who cleaned out the p-trap.  It happened again the next morning.  I told the front desk as I checked out, they said they'd have maintenance look at it but didn't seem concerned.  

I'm irritated on a personal level because the customer service was lacking.  But this is also a health issue for future guests.  I emailed the manager but haven't received a response after 4 days.

I explained that we were staying in the hotel and that breakfast was included. The employee told me if we didn't have a voucher we'd have to pay extra. 
I walked over to the hotel check-in desk, where I was told we wouldn't be charged. At the end of our meal I was handed a bill for $15.26. The employee told me I needed to sign it so she could create a voucher to void it. I verified that with the manager on duty.
Returned home, saw the charge on my Discover. Grrrrr.
Called the hotel. Got no satisfaction. Called customer service for Hilton. Was told the hotel would call me and make it right. They didn't.
Now I've been on hold for 15 minutes with Hilton Customer Service.

Last night, booked a hotel using my smartphone with a three hour drive to get there, card already on file, everything went through rather quickly. Arrived at the place, handed my license and same card as was on the reservation, they were run/photocopied. Then, they demanded an additional $50 in cash.

I've never had a hotel do that. The clerk showed me a paper-based log of other deposits, but that didn't convince me that what they were doing was proper.

I don't carry much cash in this day of electronic payments, and was asked to use their ATM. I pointed out my lengthy history without issues.

Eventually the clerk did let me stay and I didn't even shower, just slept and changed clothes.

At no point in the reservation process was there any mention of this cash requirement, so I wasn't able to be prepared for that. I also scoured the e-mail confirmation, the word ""cash"" never appeared. My card was billed for the night already, but what if I had no way of obtaining cash, especially not knowing it would be required? 

Reservations permit the hotel to re-charge the card on the reservation if there is damage of theft...I just don't engage in that kind of behavior.

I also experienced a hotel where premium movie channels on the TV would experience buffering at night whenever the hotel had high occupancy since there wasn't enough internet bandwidth.

My favorite is when the heat is out in the hotel pool and not fixed for weeks because no one bothered to read the pool temperature.

Booked direct with a small family owned place, paid a deposit for half at booking, paid the other half at checkin. Arrived, everything looked great, then we opened the door and noticed a persistent smell of mildew and urine.

Asked the front desk for air cleaning spray, they didn't have any. Asked for a different room and he said they didn't have anything comparable for the three days we were there. We wanted a nice room for my wife's birthday.

We hung around, mostly outside the room trying to convince ourselves it would work for about 2 hours. The cancellation policy states 100% nonrefundable if we cancel within 48 hours of arrival, or 10% fee if we cancel outside 48 hours. Even after reading this we decided to book another location and leave.

Packed up, told the guy we were leaving and why, and asked about a refund. All of a sudden they have a comparable room for tonight, but not the other two. I told him the decision was made and that we're leaving. He said he would have to speak with the owner about any refund. I'm calling them today to see what comes next.

Any recommendations on what I should do, or anything I should say to effect the refund? Are there any legal requirements for safe and reasonable accommodation? From my point of view, we didn't cancel the reservation but declined the service since the room reeked of piss.

ETA: the room also smelled like cleaner to mask the piss... they didn't admit to it, but it seems like they know.

2023-07-31,1690847749,WiFi Woes at Hotel - Seeking Advice for Refund,"  
I just had the most frustrating experience at a hotel, and I could really use some advice on how to proceed. I am currently on vacation, excited to enjoy my stay, but the WiFi in my hotel room has been an absolute nightmare.  
  
It all started when I tried to connect my five different iPads and my laptop to the WiFi, but my room seemed to be in a perpetual state of disconnection. No matter what I did, my devices, including my laptop, simply refused to connect. Frustrated, I took my laptop to the elevator area where I am currently writing this post because the internet is seemingly blocked in my room!  
  
What makes this situation even worse is that I am on vacation, and I deliberately chose this hotel expecting reliable WiFi. Unfortunately, due to this WiFi issue, I am unable to use any cellular data whatsoever, making it impossible to stay connected and enjoy my vacation fully.  
  
I informed the hotel manager about the issue, and they did try to help by restarting the router and even making a few calls to the tech support. However, despite their efforts, my room remains the only one unable to connect. The situation is quite perplexing.  
  
To make matters even more challenging, I was able to get a small connection on my laptop after several attempts, but this connection only works for a limited time. As a temporary solution, I've been hot-spotting my laptop's connection to the rest of my devices, but this is far from an ideal situation and causes more inconvenience.  
  
I requested to be moved to a different room, one where the WiFi actually works, but the manager outright refused my request. Now, I'm stuck with no WiFi in my room for the entirety of my stay, which is incredibly inconvenient and disappointing, especially when I'm supposed to be enjoying my vacation.  
  
Considering the hotel's failure to provide a basic service that was clearly advertised, and the fact that multiple devices, including my laptop, are unable to connect, and my inability to use any cellular data during my vacation, I feel even more entitled to a refund for this lackluster experience. However, I'm unsure about the best way to approach this situation. Has anyone else faced a similar issue while on vacation, and how did you manage to resolve it? What are my rights as a customer in this scenario, and what steps should I take to ensure I get a fair resolution?",hotels,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/15ew9t9/wifi_woes_at_hotel_seeking_advice_for_refund/

I arrive at the hotel, they inform me of the deposit needed, as expected, but when attempting to pay it (had to do a separate transaction on a pin-pad specifically just for the deposit, separate from the room cost) they then inform me they can't use any of my cards (including one used to reserve the room, as well as 2 different visas/mastercard/debit) to accept the $150 deposit and that they needed a card from a ""major bank"" and gave examples of ""like Chase or Wells Fargo.""

As you'd expect, when attempting to cancel the reservation, they tell me they'll have to keep the full payment of the room (from the same card they supposedly couldn't take my deposit off of? But could take payment for the res. and keep it?) because it was a ""non-refundable rate.""

After a few minutes of back and forth about how sketchy that was, how they need to disclose such an absurd policy on their website, and how it didn't make sense given the situation of taking my booking online and wanting to keep the money off of it despite apparently not being able to use said card at their hotel, I told them I'll get it settled another way and left.

I'm planning on disputing the charge once it goes through, but has anyone heard of a policy like this or is it even common? Only accepting ""major bank"" cards? It sounds insane to me, especially with how many people use credit unions and small banks that are not very well known nowadays. There is no notice of such an odd policy on their website, in fact, the opposite; this is part of the homepage under highlights:  ""Payments Accepted:  Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Cash.""  
I've booked over a dozen hotels in the past year and a half and have never had this kind of an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I should add: this was kind of sketchy hotel to begin with, super cheap price for a 3-bed suite (I guess you get what you pay for, although I didn't get anything out of it other than a lesson) but aside from a few ""this place needs an update/renovation"" bad reviews it seemed okay.

**I also have a hunch this might have been some sort of retaliation for getting a lower price;** due to the reviews I wanted to check it out in person to ensure it wasn't some sort of roach motel or in a terrible area, it was actually pretty nice aside from a few cosmetic issues. I go to the front desk to ask them the price, they quote me higher than their online price and I ask them if they could offer me that same price right there; they said no, so I booked it on the website and returned later (same front desk person as earlier).",hotels,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/15edv5o/hotel_needs_major_bank_card_to_accept_deposit/

As a recent former front desk agent, I wish I could tell everyone to NEVER book third party. They charge 'fees and taxes' that are often higher prices than if you had booked with the hotel directly, they offer you CSTNs (which essentially means the hotel picks how many beds you have for you depending on availability!), and cancelling your third party reservation is INFINITELY harder than if you had booked with the hotel directly. Your requests are barely ever guaranteed if you book third party (adjoining rooms, rooms close together, good luck!) and it is VERY difficult to get money back if there is a problem with the hotel. 

If you routinely book with third parties - good for you, you might see a bit of a discount. But this is a word of warning from a very recent employee of a major hotel chain - do NOT book third party! Always better to book with the hotel directly. Guarantees a refund if there's an issue with the room you booked, guarantees your room type (only exception being a maintenance issue), and almost certainly guarantees any special requests you might have. Plus, if you sign up for the hotel's rewards program, you get points for you stay. ",hotels,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/15dbtm6/do_not_book_third_party_this_is_your_warning/

I booked THE DAY BEFORE and I literally didn't pay any mind to the fact that the oyo guy had an Indian accent until further research. I get to the front desk the next day to find out a) they cancelled my reservation but on the res it says ""guest called to cancel"" 
B) 50 dollar deposit I was never told about OTP (had to be cash but when I looked at reviews they charged people's cards with the deposit and those people never got their deposit back) and c) they double charged my card

So I'm obviously upset because I drove 8 hours for a funeral just to find out we had no where to sleep. The manager felt bad and told me if I could come up with the deposit(understanding that the last of my money at that moment was all taken away) she would cover for my room. She even said she sent both refunds in and I would get them in no more than ten days. 

I got the first charge refunded, then two weeks later, the other refund has not been seen. I called oyo just to fight with some useless mf who (after three different calls to this place and having to explain and be explained my situation) tells me that since I cancelled it, I don't get a refund because it was after a certain time. I never cancelled it! I NEVER FUCKING CANCELLED IT AND WHEN I MADE THE RESERVATION, THE GUY TOLD ME CHECK IN WAS AT 3. NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

2023-07-29,1690625340,How do you get huge discounts on hotel bookings? Is it better to book directly with the hotel?,"In a nutshell, yes, it's better to book directly with the hotel.

Hotels frequently offer exclusive deals and promotions on their official websites, giving you the opportunity to secure lower rates.

When you book directly, you can also negotiate directly. Hotel managers have some leeway in offering discounts, especially during off-seasons or when booking for an extended stay. Third-party booking sites do not allow for this.

Booking directly with the hotel may also provide additional benefits in addition to the discount, such as special perks and upgrades. These perks may include amenities such as complimentary breakfast, access to leisure facilities, or room upgrades, which will enhance your overall experience.

By booking directly, you can take advantage of the hotel's [loyalty program benefits](https://www.toodat.com/community/Howdoyouge/TricksTips/z4yJrb2k1JdWLDX7). Loyalty programs frequently offer exclusive benefits such as reduced rates, room upgrades, late check-out, and even access to exclusive events.

2023-07-28,1690586013,Booking Direct....,"Honestly, I used to be the biggest proponent of booking direct, but I can't even say that anymore. I've worked at several different hotels in the US, and one in Asia.

At my first hotel, we could of course honor ANY rate that the guest showed. If they showed us a lower rate on Agoda (which there always was), we always matched it. I thought that was a given.

Then I experienced working at a hotel (still in the US, mind you), where straight up, the person training me (this was a Director of Front Office) showed me that when a guest calls and asks to book, but says ""I found a lower rate on whatever.com"", the answer was ""Then book it on there then"". I was horrified since I have past experience and saw how wrong that was (that manager really just wanted to get fired I think, but he was stuck there for like 10 years). But everyone else at the desk was trained by him also and had no experience, and so happily told guests who booked scammy, cheap rates ""Please just book it on that site then!"" I'm now just imagining them going to other hotels and trying that... yikes.

Then I went to Asia. LOL... has anyone tried to book a hotel in Korea or Japan? I called several of them and they all had the same answer when I asked them if they could match the rate:

""So sorry, but we can't do that. You can book it to get that price""

""But... But then you don't have to pay commission.""

""Mmm... sorry, still no. You can book it on that site you see.""

Now that I've worked at a hotel in Asia, I'm wondering if this is the case for all of them - but apparently, it's because at the hotel I worked at, it felt like they were ""stealing"" guests from these companies. And I was like ""Well... yeah. They're booking a room and rate that was stolen from us, let's steal them back"" but it's apparently a rude thing to do or something.

Just trying to get a sense of if this is worth the premium, admitting this is something of a subjective matter.

I've got a trip coming up that has me flying into JFK for 16 hours before leaving out of JFK at 6am, so I thought I'd stay there to make it easier to get to the gate in the morning.  As someone who regularly flew TWA as a kid, seeing many of the same crew coming &amp; going year after year (not hyperbole), I have very fond memories of the carrier making it sort of up my alley.

However, two things are giving me pause.

1. Cost.  When I looked at prices about a month ago, a night in a room with a great view was in the upper $300's/low $400's but today it looks like it'll run $521 with advance pay.   I estimate the cost of staying at the Hilton JFK + the ride to/fro to be around $400 so an extra $100 for nostalgia and easy access to the airport, seems an OK premium.
2. This review [https://onemileatatime.com/insights/twa-hotel-jfk-airport/](https://onemileatatime.com/insights/twa-hotel-jfk-airport/)  Granted this was a few years back I'm *hoping* things have changed for the better.

Several parter answer here, yet I hope helps.. =

Over all, I'll cover, ""booking systems"" some, the 3 major ""booking systems"" used to bring in guests, give a thumbs up to Sales Directors and conclude with why undercuting a hotel sucks...

****
If ya mean the computer program at the desk, that veries from franchise to franchise, hotel to hotel... Often depends on what they can afford.  Others have already mentioned or may have mentioned, Opera, On-Q, Synesis, and of the like... It's because hotels pay for that access. So off the bat, you're paying into someone else's system. As for usability of all the systems, just like flying an airplane, driving a car, or using a word document processor, they all have ""the basic features..."" Anyone who understands the terminology and lingo of one, can probably figure out any other system as if they're all part of a video game genre your familiar with. The industry is older than the Bible itself, so we definitely have our own staple terms that cross over between brands and systems.


*** As to where they get reservations from?
The primary goal is, ""who are you pretending to be... and who are you trying to catering to?""

Pretty much from day 1, ""the building"" itself practically has to join a hotel group in looks. Be it one's like Wyndham, Choice, Hilton, etc... They all bring in a consistent flow of people/income and get you extra advertising ya can't afford by just being by yourself... So unless you're gonna be the next Donald Trump and build your own brand, (effectively doing the same thing...) even when breaking ground for the building/hotel itself, you're forced into making a choice on what styles to build for what brands ya can afford to give a cut too to cover the uses of their logos, reward program reimbursement access, and the ""booking system(s),"" themselfs. (In the industry, we call the overall thing, flags and pins...) It's just like burger joints... They have McDonalds and Burger Kings to choose from as your basic options if ya want brand recognition.  (Ever be like, ""that place WAS obviously a Pizza Hut?"" Yeah, same idea...)


**""Now for 3'd party guest sourcing..... Most use the same booking system, Expidia's the monopoly system hands down for 3'd party websites, but they somewhat work with the Brand names' systems... Loosly. Even if they claim to be Booking.com and such, Expidia owns the search and booking software that auto-publieshes availability to websites like the ones Google pitches to ya, (even fly by night website offers from websites ya never even heard of.) No matter who it is, Expidia is who they book through. However, if ya have an actual decent booking agent... Aka person....  A good Booking Agent will actually make a deal with the physical hotel directly. Thus super confirming your reservation... ""No Elses."" The hotel wants repeat customers so they'll cator to booking agents excitedly.

So.... everyone is sort of forced to join the Expidia network and it's subsidiaries; like booking.com and whomever comes up with a website and willing to pay Expedia access dues... Luckily Expdia covers that for ya, so they are the only ones ya need to sign up for to have your hotel listed on every Tom, Dick, and Harry website.  Expidia has their own booking system but no ""physical hotel"" locations other than what's in their grifting network.  (Sorta like those off the road budget car insurance places that will ""always find ya the best rates,"" but ya always have to pay in person, probably in cash.)

Expidia and their ilk make their money by undercutting the hotel 20-40% and selling your personal info to 3'der parties to make up their costs. So they're often the first resurvations to be cancelled in a crisis if the hotel can't accommodate. Grant it, it could be because of Expidia overbooking the hotel, the hotel had an emergency, and/or simply, $200+ bucks for a room (especially or for a membership guest) easily beats out a room you're only gonna get a few bucks off of anyway. Expedia also often gives us delinquent credit cards and the wrong phone number to contact you... that can easily get your reservation canceled. *** A complaint from a Hotels' Loyalty Program Member/Guest is easily more important than some random 3'd parties' complaint. Especially when Expidia often send ya 16 to 18 year olds not even listed on the reservation and the policy is 21+ and/or they don't know what incidentals are. Luckily to the hotel, the reservation is ""Expidia's reservation..."" So Expidia is the one responsible for finding you a new hotel.. no ""walks"" for a 3'd party from us... Usually.  (Ever notice you can't get a recipe from the hotel upon checkout after ya prepaid online?)

Even worse, if you're promised a refund from the hotel, that's not technically 100% up to the hotel to give you that because it's not ""the hotel's resurvation."" The hotel isn't charging ""YOU"" personally. Also, the hotel isn't required to give you loyalty points considering you didn't even pay them.  That would be double dipping... Expidia doesn't like that ether because you're stealing their clientele as well.

Comps/Refunds promised by the hotel not being upheld?  Well... The third party took your money and took your information to sell to other 3'd parties to make up their costs, (it's in Expidia's TOS/Terms of Service,) Yay, ya saved 10 bucks.. ># None the less, the hotel itself can't souly promise you that compensation or free night stay anyway... (Of course almost everyone still blames the hotel... Yet all the 3'd party has to do is call the hotel and ask not to be charged.. and they have a very iffy chance on actually doing so... unless ya booked a room for the wrong date.)

3'd parties are usually considered ""1 Star"" people who didn't know they could just call the hotel, have a decent conversation with the front desk agent/manager, and probably get a better rate with more privacy handling then what Expidia could ever offer. (This often isn't mentioned because even front desk people don't like playing phone operator all the time.. but I'm pushing to help people, not personal conveniency here.)


*** Corporate Lodging Cards... (CLC)

If you're hotel is absolutely desperate enough, (like... really friggin desperate,) they can also sign up for CLC... They have their own website, fax options, and walk-in potentials.  So..... they often overbook your hotel causing hicks yelling at ya in the middle of the night and/or over the phone when you're sold out.  They only pay the hotel about 42 to 73 bucks, 94 bucks (that's after tax,) if you're lucky.. Even for a $200 room. 

They obviously don't get recipes ether just like the Expidia stays... They'll yell at the CLC company realizing the difference wondering why they had to pay so much.... It severally undercuts anything else out there as to what the hotel actually gets or pockets. CLC forces the hotel to honor a 2 day stay as a 1 day stay depending on a 24 hour check-in and check-out time window.

The positive, while charging the guest's company obviously less than $200~ but obviously not anything close to the ADR. (This is the ""Average Daily Rate"" everyone is paying.) CLC is a super scam... except for it's convenient way of getting truckers into actual beds without the company needing to show up in person or send credit card authorization forms... thus getting truckers into that beds more or less pretty efficiently. So ya better hope your parking lot is prepared for trucks, construction equipment, (that often gets stolen,) and you're not already sold out within 24 hours or the next day when checking them in.
Good luck with that! >#=>#=>#=
Again, you've gotta be very desperate as a hotel to count on this review... However personally I'll take a CLC over a room with a declined credit card any day. 
Don't go 3'd party.

***
These are the 3 basic ways of pulling in guests for your hotel outside of a competent Sales Director who actually lives and hangs out in the community who notices and pulls in groups of people from local events and companies who outsource their work... they need places to stay too. That's where group rates come in.. and those are always negotiable. =


*****
In conclusion, if ya ever wonder why your hotel looks crappy, there's not enough breakfast, ya don't get automatic daily cleaning, or your reservation was canceled, ya can blame a lot of things. (And I'm very skilled at rambling why obviously... =) It's hard for us (the stand alone hotel) to ask for a budget (from several overhead corporations and owners) to pay for everything that needs to be done on a daily basis when so many undercut the system; hence driving up inflation... 

The numbers don't lie to cooperate. People do.. it's ""us"" vrs ""them"" vrs ""our guests."" It's a horrible system that is very new to this industry compared to its years on earth.  Especially with people who don't claim the appropriate amount of people in a room just to save a buck and sneak in pets.  They put their families at risk, (the fire department doesn't know how many people to save,) and things like ""free breakfast"" and housekeeping budgets are also cut because it's based on numbers too.  So for anyone who thinks going cheep on their family by not claiming who's in the room... is it worth it?~ especially your most precious thing... your family?

Just remember ya get what ya pay for.  Including the worst possible tragedy I can think of.. for what, just to save a buck? =-

I'll put my Family over money any day, and that's not just me. ddd

(Don't even get me started on how they also tend to think the credit card on file with no CC Auth can be used...)

Though, even in those times, I'll do my best to help... like call the number on the reservation (even if rarely Expedia even gives us the correct phone number anyway,) and ask that person if they would like to add a name to the room who's allowed to check in without them being present... I do have some sort of courtesy rather than just saying ""absolutely no, please leave... ""

Of course they claim they've never heard that before and gonna report me. Blah blah blah... Okay.

My response, (and also testing if I should kick them out because they might pose a threat to guests or staff,) ""By all means, please Google, Yelp, and whatever ya want too to tell people on how I did my job, it actually looks good on paper for me.""

And of course for the rare times when I have an overhead manager with me and ask them to explain the same (all hotels are supposed to do this) type policies, the person then cowers and says, ""I didn't ask for that.""

We stay at the same hotel every weekend only for 3 nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My wife works nights while I work days. We have been traveling to this location for about 8 or so months now every weekend and have yet to have an issue until recently. Where my wife works nights, she is sleeping throughout the day while I am working. We specifically put out the DND sign on the door and also a note to further clarify that she works nights, is sleeping so please do not disturb. Now up until now this has worked fine and the housekeepers have usually been respectful about this and not knocked or tried to enter but as of recently we have had a housekeeper bang on the door relentlessly for like 5 minutes straight and also leave a note that says ""you must pick a time for me to come in"". We have reiterated to the management that my wife sleeps during the day and does not need to be awoken by someone banging on the door but all they do is point to a sign on there desk that basically says ""housekeepers can come in your room at anytime"". Now I understand they want to keep the room cleaned up so let me also say we go out of our way to keep the room as reasonably tidy as possible and have done so everytime we have stayed there for the past 8 months so it's not like we have a history of leaving it in shambles or anything.

This week my direct manager and my general manager told me that I had been ""hand picked"" for a supervisor position at one of our sister hotels. The hotel is a 12 hour drive from where I live so I would have to relocate. It would be a pay increase and I would have more authority. I would also get to do more things in the specific hospitality field I'm interested in (revenue management). They said that they would pay the cost of me breaking my lease.

The city that the new hotel is in looks nice and would be safer than the city I live in now.

I know agoda charges extra if you use their conversion, but I thought if in the booking details, if it says you will be charged in the destination's currency, then it should charge that currency to your card?

2023-07-10,1689026577,Non refundable room and problems with bathroom and balcony/view,"I booked an accomodation in Croatia for 2 persons over booking.com.

In the property information it says ""Double room with balcony"" and the facilities include private bathroom. However the area of the room is stated as 12 square meters. The room is not refundable. The review rate is 8.8. 

A day after I booked the room, I received a welcome message from the host. Among other stuff it informed me that the room does have a private bathroom, but it's located outside the room, basically next door. You have to get out of the room, walk 10 meters in a shared area and you find your bathroom.

Today we arrived and saw the room and basically liked it, other than the bathroom situation.

We also saw that the room itself doesn't have a balcony or any sea view. There's a shared terrace among all rooms, with a sea view and also a shared kitchen.

We're okay with all this, but we feel that the info and facilities page about the room didn't tell the whole truth. About the bathroom, the balcony and the view.

Yes, I understand that one can deduce from the size of the room that it can't have a bathroom ensuite, but I'd prefer to have it written clearly. Also, when I read room with a balcony and sea view, I tend to think that these features are for the room and not shared. Is it me being weird/naive?

Another thing: Seems that the host sends to every guest this informative message about the bathroom after they booked the *non refundable* room. Wouldn't it be easier to just write it in the room informations? Looks a bit like a red flag.

We will keep the room and enjoy our few days vacation. No huge deal from our side. Just trying to understand and learn from the situation.

Palm Beach Parklands has benefited from considerable embelishments over the last 18 months which has transformed this already beautiful natural beach and river environment into a magnificent family friendly parkland area that is now arguably the best beach spot on the Gold Coast. There are so many options for you and your family to connect with the ocean, from walking trails that take in endless beaches, calm water safe swimming areas for children, funky gazebo's perched on the waters edge, riverbank bush reserves, wildlife sanctuary's, river board walks, open parkland areas, exercise points, sand dunes and rock wall features.  
  
Currumbin lagoon also offers great sheltered swimming and has an open grassed parkland area with a pirate play ground providing endless entertainment for the kids along with the "" Dune Cafe "" next door for that much needed coffee break.  This is in addition to the open spaces and a nature reserve with many secluded white sandy, calm water beaches with picture perfect picnic spots on the waters edge making the southern end of Palm Beach the best waterfront spot on the whole of the Gold Coast.  
  
Palm Beach on the Gold Coast is located a short 7 minute drive north of the Gold Coast Airport with public transport to Blue Ocean Apartment stopping directly in front of the building saving you the 1 hour plus courtesy bus treck to Surface Paradise after your flight to the Gold Coast.

2023-09-03,1693710609,Deplorable experience,"Comfort Inn and Suites Harvey, La

This location is a deplorable representation of your brand. If we had not already driven out of our way to stay in a brand that we are used to being totally satisfied with in the past and hadnt just driven 8 hours to get to, we wouldve walked out. 

First off on the walk to our room we are greeted to a whole stretch of hallway with ceiling tiles missing because of an apparent water leak. The hallway reeked of a mixture of bleach and mildew from said water leak. A huge trash can is blocking the hallway catching water and gives you a nice unavoidable splash as you walk by. We are well aware that things happen but this clearly isnt the way to handle the situation and a simple apology for the state of the hallway would go far.

Then we enter the room and the mildew/mold smell continues with the addition of smoke in a non smoking hotel. We are traveling with in-laws and our infant daughter.  We go to turn the tv on and neither tv is working. Try all the inputs and nothing works.  There are two tvs controlled by one remote.  When trying to call the front desk we realized the phone does not work. So I made my way to the desk to be told that none of the phones work in any of the rooms. They did have someone come in and check everything and he did get everything working, albeit aggravated having to come and do it. 

Several outlets were not working and had to pull out the night stand and there was about an inch of dust behind it so we could test the outlets.  Sleeping with a cpap machine because of obstructive sleep apnea makes having power outlets that function essential.  

There was no place in the closet to hang our clothes, because it was completely empty as if it has been stripped. 


We had made a reservation for the suite because we needed the extra hideaway couch for a bed. For one there were no additional linens. Upon opening the couch I decided to not use the disgusting mattress, and figured I would just sleep on the couch. When trying to return the cushions on the bed, we saw unmentionable stains on the cushions so they had to be returned in a way that we could avoid those stains. Instead of using the blankets to cover up with I used them to avoid touching the couch at all. Makes for a lovely nights sleep.

One of the selling points of the Comfort Inn/Suites brand is the good hot breakfast. By 7am the syrup was empty and they were completely out of butter. The mini fridge was completely empty except for a small amount of cream cheese, therefore no yogurt or coffee creamer. The only bread option was plain bread or a bagel. Clearly they are not prepared for anyone to be eating any breakfast. 

The ice maker didnt work on the first floor and were told we had to go to the fourth floor, because that was the only ice machine working in the building. We waited for 5 minutes and only got a few clumps of ice we didnt even trust to use for anyone to drink. 

Then the elevator appeared to keep getting stuck between floors three and four and would finally get down to the first floor after a few tries.  

It was shocking knowing the level of service your brand has given in the past to come into this motel.  They say you get what you pay for, but for almost $200 for one night, we definitely paid for a $50 hotel. We have exclusively used your brand for years. In fact a couple summers ago we spend two weeks at a different Choice Hotel every night and had impeccable service.

Should we stay here or just book another hotel?

When I was at the hotel, I requested someone to look at the security cameras but was told they didn't have access and said the general manager would be coming at 9:30 a.m. I waited 24 hours to no avail. They kept changing the time the manager was going to come in. They may have a thief at the hotel who could be an employee or a guest, and they show no remorse or care in the world.

2023-09-01,1693574443,"Hotels always say there's zero rooms available after ~9pm, why is that?","Hi everyone, I'm a bit of a disorganized last-minute traveller (especially when traveling or biking off the cuff). I use [hotels.com](https://hotels.com). I notice that if I look for hotels at around 3pm, I find an ample supply. However, if I look around 9pm (for a same night booking) there's nothing available. Now, I always assume that's because the booking sites have a cut-off time, so then I often call the hotels myself and they always say they're all booked up. One time I had to travel 100 miles to a motel 6 because that's all I could find, and I was in a major city (Cincinnati).

My question is.. are they *really* booked or is there some sort of *don't allow people to check in that late* policy (perhaps to avoid people that are up to no good?). I find it so hard to believe that there's nothing available anywhere as soon as night time hits.. but then again, maybe there's lots of last minute bookings by people who need to crash (like me)?

Now I'm 100% sure I left them there, but if they don't find them I'm not sure what I should do. Do I ask them for the names of the staff that cleaned the room between yesterday and today, am I able to take legal action? What if the new occupants take them?

I understand that it's my fault for being so forgetful and careless but is there anything I can do if the hotel staff decides to just pocket my cards?

Anyway- one of my dogs is very old- he's deaf, night blind and covered in tumors. When I went to take him out at 8am - he had an accident (pee) in the lobby right beside the elevator. Immediately I told the front desk and said ""I am SO sorry- my dog is old and he just had an accident"". They said ""awww, don't worry- we'll get it for you!"" And I said ""thank you so much! And again- I'm so sorry!"" 

So I take the dogs out, come back in a few minutes later- and I'm confronted by a lady that looks like a manger - she shouted from across the lobby ""Excuse me, you need to go find some towels and dry that up since it's in the lobby"". I said ""ok"" so I went to my room, got 2 towels and came back down and dried it up. 

I understand it's my dog and my responsibility - and if they gave me paper towels when it first happened, I would have cleaned it up with no issue whatsoever - but I'm so upset as to how this went down. This can't be standard procedure? Why would they want me to use bath towels instead of them using a mop?

2023-08-28,1693198331,Stop acting like sex workers ruin your hotel experience!!!,"Ok, so Im a sex worker. Sorry not sorry. First of all, Im not advertising here, nor do I trust Im in good company. Destroy my karma. Whatever lol. Im gonna say what needs to be said. I read many reviews of many different hotels. One thing that jumps out to me is all the hatred of sex workers. First of all, mind your business. Secondly, its none of your goddamn business. And if sex workers at your hotel bother you then get a life. It makes you look like a real asshole to complain about hookers. You think youre some high n mighty mf but youre just a whiny liberty stealing freedom hating douche. Besides theres no such thing as a prostitute. Were sex workers. And no matter what you do for a living your job came after mine. So step aside and respect the worlds oldest profession. All the prudery and laws against have not stopped us, nor will they ever. Might as well support your neighbors. Were everywhere. We vote. And we dont appreciate your bigoted attitude. Besides, were cooler than you and your mamma too. Maybe you hate us for our freedom. But if youre mad we exist, take it up with your god. I mean were older than Jesus. And even that fictional character didnt hate us. Complaining about sex workers at your hotel doesnt stop us from showing up. Thats like complaining about guests of another race and acting like youre gonna stop em from showing up, like youre saying something of value. Youre not. Youre just an ignorant bonehead. Your opinions are as worthless as your existence. Next time act like a decent human being and be nice. Im a sex worker, true. But I carry Narcan, first aid, and I know how to use a defibrillator. I might be a whore but if you have a medical emergency I could save your life. Which Ive done a couple of times. What about me being worthless when youre dying? Are you willing to risk your life just to push others away whom you dont approve of? Well, good luck to ya. But remember, you dont know who we all are. I might be a hot, sexy, unbelievably talented woman. And for that I offer no apologies. If youre scared or intimidated by us, believe me, were more scared of you. Because too many people are stupid enough in this failed state to think people like me deserve no rights. Then they talk about liberty being an important value to them, all while not knowing the definition. The Liberty Bell and the Statue of Liberty are hollow symbols. Theyre as worthless as the illusion they represent in this country. So when you attack sex workers, you have attacked the very principles you claim to love when you get all patriotic. Nah, youre idiotic. Stop acting like sex workers ruined your good time. Youre the buzzkill. You the same one to smell like a fart took a shit and yet still complain about the smell of drugs. Lol stfu. Imagine if everyone we dont approve of was made illegal. Hows that good in a so-called free country? So in closing, next time you see a sex worker just mind your business.

2023-08-23,1692809506,Hotel staff - what's a nice gesture after a long stay?,"I've spent the last 6 weeks in a hotel for work purposes. Might not sound like a long time but it feels like home at this point! 

The hotel staff have been really lovely and, especially since noticing how long I've been staying, have gone out of their way to be friendly and add little extra touches that have made the stay more enjoyable. 

I'd like to leave some sort of thank you but I don't know what's appropriate. For context, it's a British chain hotel in the middle of a busy city center (Edinburgh, Scotland). The hotel itself is large in size and staff numbers. I can't leave a cash tip for everyone as any meaningful amount would cost a fortune, and I also think it would feel a bit awkward as tipping culture is not the same here in the UK as it is in lots of other countries.

2023-08-14,1692045169,ALILA NAPA VALLEY - A Dream Anniversary Devastated by False Accusations and Disturbing Noise Levels,"My partner and I meticulously chose this hotel to commemorate our cherished 1-year anniversary. We envisioned tranquility, a haven where memories could gracefully unfold. Unfortunately, our stay became an agonizing ordeal on multiple fronts.  
From the outset, we were incessantly disrupted by noise disturbances. The insulationor the glaring lack thereofmeant that we could hear every single footstep from our upstairs neighbors, transforming their regular movements into thunderous interruptions. The connecting room doors proved to be no barrier at all, as we could distinctly hear every word, every sound from the adjacent guests. The promise of a relaxing stay, a respite from the world, was shattered by the hotel's inadequate infrastructure.  
This could have been a mere inconvenience, but what followed was unfathomable. We received a chilling call from the housekeeping manager, Rosemarie Alberto, who accused us, with stern conviction, of possessing ""crystal meth"" in our room. Stunned and reeling, we watched police officers walk into our space, only to identify the suspicious ""substance"" as my innocuous Celtic salt.  
One would expect an establishment to recognize, regret, and rectify such a monumental blunder. Instead, they chose to evict us, using our response to Rosemarie's accusatory tone as a pretext. Appeals to the higher management, particularly Sergio Antonio Jimenez Dena, met with apathy and dismissiveness.  
Prospective guests should be wary. The allure of this place is overshadowed by its structural sound issues, rendering any hope for relaxation moot. Furthermore, our harrowing experience with false accusations and the management's refusal to acknowledge their grievous errors speaks volumes.  
To those seeking a peaceful, respectful, and memorable stay, I urge you to look elsewhere. Our quest for a cherished anniversary memory resulted in an ordeal that will forever haunt our hearts.

2023-10-12,1697145935,Marriott Reservation Estimate is less than what Booking Site charged me Question,"I was wondering if anyone has encountered this and knows if I can save some money.  
  
About a month ago I booked a stay at a Marriott Hotel through a Bank of America vendor to get additional cash back. That booking site charged me around $1100, which is meant to include the room rate and the estimated taxes and fees.  
  
I entered the confirmation number on the Marriott website, and see that the total estimate (including taxes and fees) is around $700. The billing information on the confirmation receipt is not my own, so I assume it's the vendor's info. I seem to have the ability to edit this information.  
  
So now my question is, do I call the booking site and get some information and inquire about a partial refund, or is this just how these places operate? I feel like I could edit the billing information in the Marriott system, and cancel the reservation through the booking site and get my $1100 back from them. My only concern is that the booking site could still cancel using the confirmation number.  
  
Has anyone encountered this before or have any advice? From Googling, I can't seem to find anything describing this sort of situation.

2023-10-05,1696515053,How can I reach Choice Hotels?,"I made a reservation for this weekend over two months ago at a Radisson. I got a call yesterday afternoon from Choice Hotels, less than 48 hours before I was set to check in, saying that the hotel is no longer a Radisson and that I needed to call the hotel directly to decide if I still wanted the reservation. I called the number that was left in the voicemail, that looks like a local number, but it actually sent me to the oversees Choice Hotels call center. I explained the situation and asked them to connect me to the actual physical hotel. After speaking with no fewer than 12 customer service reps spanning about six calls/two and a half hours (their phones are awful and disconnect frequently, meaning you then have to call back and start all over) no one really had any information for me. They couldn't connect me to the hotel, they couldn't tell me if there even was still an operating hotel in that location, and they couldn't tell me whether, if there is, it would be honoring reservations made when it was a Radisson. But the best part is that they were adamant that I would still be charged for the room (even if it's now a vacant lot!) and that I would need to dispute the charge with my bank. 

I am at a loss. I called every single one of Choice Hotels' various customer service lines, but they all lead to the same call center and no one there knows what is going on. So I am expected to travel to this destination and find out then if I even have a place to stay. And even if I don't, I'll still be charged and then I need to duke it out with my bank. Before you say ""just go somewhere else"" trust me I so wish I could. I would do anything to not give Choice a single dollar for the rest of my life. But it happens to be Homecoming weekend in this city for a Big 10 university, so there are quite literally no other rooms available. 

Does anyone know how I can reach Choice corporate? I simply want to know 1. is there an operating hotel at that location? and 2. will it be honoring reservations that were made when it was a Radisson?

2023-09-29,1695949081,Rack rate. Price hike at check-in?,"I reserved 4 rooms for my team at the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center for a work trip, **check-in Sat Sep 30, check-out Thurs Oct 05  (5 nights)**, using a discount code. The discounted rate was $150 per night including taxes. I made the reservation on August 15. There is a conference happening in the neighborhood from Sun Oct 01 to Thurs Oct 05. It usually attracts 4000+ attendees so there is high demand during this time.

After contacting the hotel, I realized we do not have the documentation that needs to be furnished at check-in to obtain the discounted rate. So I asked the hotel to apply the standard rate. The hotel representative said there are no rooms currently available for those dates, so the standard rate does not show up on their system. They said that **they can only tell me the rate during check-in**, not ahead of time. This makes me uncomfortable because we are at the mercy of the hotel during check-in.

\- - What can I expect the average per night rate to be? I will be happy if it is under $400 per night.

\- - Is there an upper limit to what the hotel can legally charge? I read that the rack rate is the maximum a hotel can legally charge at all times, but this article ([https://www.igms.com/rack-rate/](https://www.igms.com/rack-rate/)) says the price can be increased during high demand periods.

\- - How do I find the rack rate for this hotel? It is not listed on their website ([https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dtwdt-detroit-marriott-at-the-renaissance-center/overview/](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dtwdt-detroit-marriott-at-the-renaissance-center/overview/) ).

Shortly after clocking in one day I decided to see if anything interesting was going on on the admin computer. The owner's wife doesn't care if we use it, but it's a very particular machine.

I opened Edge and was looking at the home page (msn or something similar) when I noticed one of the search results simply said ""porn"". I was like, um....Amber? Did you know about this?

Turns out from the timestamps this person looked up porn multiple times at like 3 am, and one time they went to a religious temple site immediately afterwards, a very specific one not many people would visit. I told Amber (owner's wife) and screenshotted it for evidence, but I think it was her husband, the owner, my boss looking at it, because at that time there is usually only one person manning the desk, and well, most of my coworkers and myself hadn't been hired yet when it was being viewed.  

I feel really uncomfortable knowing this and working there. Also why use a work computer for that? I feel like the majority of people know better than to do that. But tbf the owner and his wife are older and not super tech literate. 

The big question is, how do I respond otherwise to this and do I talk to corporate about this misuse of company property? I know we're a franchise and not owned by the company proper. Who do I talk to about this?

Im currently staying at a Home 2 Suites in Las Vegas for a work trip. Im here for 2 weeks. Being a gamer, I decided to bring my Xbox to entertain myself during down time. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi, but its waaaay too slow to be able to play anything online. There is an Ethernet port that is currently connected to the tv in the room. I used the cable that I brought to get a wired connection for my console(after unplugging the cable going to the tv), and it turns out that the speed is remarkably fast. 

My question is, if I continue to use this connection, is the hotel going to charge me? I only ask because Im using a company credit card to pay for the room, and I dont want a surprise charge at the end of my 2 week stay.",hotels,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/16j0hwe/internet_advice/

Im currently working to open a hotel and for the tv's i would like to open the tv with a welcome message, a instruction to go to live television and an option to select: cast to this certain tv with your own smartphone.

\*\*\*\*Where did i see this:\*\*\*\*A hotel in Scotland (hotelchain) used a software called Nevaya and it worked on an Samsung tv.The TV only showed a welcome page, time, options underneath to select live tv and a cast page. Cast page showed instructions how to cast to this certain tv.

\*\*\*\*What are the issues:\*\*\*\*To cast to a tv you need to be connected with the same network as the chromecast. That means that you can also cast to the neighbours tv. I know i can make 12 seperate wifi (vlan) names with it needs to be less complicated.

\*\*\*\*What's to do already:\*\*\*\*Samsung smart tv's can be unlocked with the code: Mute - 1 -1 - 9 - enter. It opens an menu where you can select hospitality mode. In this mode you can turn off certain functions plus change input devices as start up. (chromecast for instance).*I could use a android hdmi device but i dont like the reliabilty of that.I*Im not sure if you can select: open an url as a start up page but it would be something to show a personal hotel page. Plus i dont want guests to change the tv settings.

\*\*\*\*What can it cost:\*\*\*\*For only 12 tv's a subscription plan is something that i dont like. I understand that certain functions costs money but there's always a different way to tackle this.

This investment stands out in several ways. Firstly, it is a real estate asset generating regular rental income. Hotels are leased year-round, ensuring stable rents for investors.  
  
Furthermore, hospitality can yield significant capital gains. The dynamic hotel market allows for a rapid increase in asset prices.  
  
Lastly, it is a diversified investment, with a variety of hotels offering unique characteristics and investment opportunities.

According to a study by the National Hotel Federation (FNH), the French hotel sector recorded a growth of 5.5% in 2022.  
  
According to a study by the World Bank, the global hotel market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030.

2023-11-14,1699946737,Which hotel should I book for Tokyo? Grand Hyatt vs. The Okura,"I have narrowed it down to two hotels. I like them both and so I came up with some highlights  


# Grand Hyatt

**Highlights:**  
\- I can start working my way towards status with Hyatt. This would be 11 nights worth  
\- The location, based on what I've read, is good  


# The Okura

**Highlights:**

\- Slightly more expensive than the Grand Hyatt  
\- It's a japanese owned hotel so outside of Japan there's no usable loyalty or status I can accrue.  
\- Less western from what I hear so I suppose more authentic relatively speaking
\- The location is good, but slightly less than the Grand Hyatt, based on what I've read.  
\- slightly bigger in terms of square footage  


Any other details I missed for those who have stayed in either place in Tokyo? I do want to start building up loyalty with a hotel chain but if the Okura is worth it then I'm willing to book that instead.

Ex: Art&gt; Works to visit in our area
Economy&gt; Costs and tourism company
Mathematics&gt; Data graphs about tourism
Ecc..

I will take care of the IT sector and will have the task of creating a platform that will simulate a hotel website. I remind you that the hotel is sustainable and is located in the area near the school.

Premises: I have no knowledge of programming but I like technology, that's why I chose this sector. I found ""WebFlow"" as a site creation engine and then I would like to transform the product into an html file without publishing it online, so that it has all the functionality of a site, but without any expense.

Now let's move on to my expectations: I would like the ""site"" to contain information about the hotel but also about the creation of the site itself which aims to have minimal environmental costs and promote tourism in my area. In fact, I would like the site itself to have its own value and to have content about which I can say something during the presentation (since I will have to present it during the oral test).

Now I ask you for help to give me ideas and practical advice regarding these points:
- Do you think WebFlow can work? Will I be able to download the working html file without having to publish it? If yes, how?
- What content should I add to the site to make it interesting, complete and consistent with my presentation? (Digital eco-sustainability, tourism, territory).
- How can I give the idea of a sustainable site? I mean for example by saying that I would publish it on servers with low energy consumption... or other ideas?

Thanks for the attention. Now I'm waiting to receive some ideas and answers to my questions so that I can create a finished, good quality product thanks also to the help of Redditors!",hotels,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/17ufnn8/graduation_project/

When the interface works its generally easy to use and designed in a thoughtful way with pics, a great mapping system and prices for hotels are given including taxes and fees for the entire stay, unique to this system in my experience.  Recently the system has been listing apartments for super cheap rates but then as one is about to confirm the reservation the cleaning fee appears and is frequently five times the rental fee. This an abhorrent corporate practice that the system has not used in the past. Other, major deficiencies become clear when things dont go as planned. Ive arrived at BNBs to find they had no rooms, or the room was not fit for  human habitation - box spring and no mattress, sink hanging off the wall with no hot water,  gas furnace on the wall without an external duct, live flame and no smoke alarms (in Milford CT!) etc. While in Hungary last month I was robbed of cash by cleaners and booking has not responded to three messages about the event after responding to only the first cursory mention of the robbery.

2023-11-13,1699867436,"PSA from hotel security, we can see y'all on camera","Hello, this is just to remind people staying in hotels that we do in fact have cameras. I am only saying this to make all of our lives easier, you are not being sneaky, I promise you. Don't try to smoke in the lobby, don't be sneaking around trying to open locked doors, going to the pool after hours, or opening exit doors. I see you, and everyone in security sees you, please stop for all of our sakes as it's super awkward for you when we confront you and annoying for us that you are just breaking rules. And if anyone is wondering, no, the people who do these things are not mostly kids so this applies to all of you, but for teens yes we do see you sneaking around and trying to get to the hot tub while you're on your school field trips. Basically, when you're in hallways, lobby, or elevators just try and act like you're on camera because you are.

EDIT: Unsurprisingly people are taking this too seriously, I understand people have bad experiences with security, but it does not mean my PSA is untrue. Any decent hotel you go to will have cameras and hopefully security to watch it, to answer some general questions/concerns. No, not every hotel has cameras everywhere, but just like every other service and business usually the more expensive it is the better it will be. Of course, that's not a universal truth and if you have legitimate security concerns then contact the hotel before booking and ask. I agree you shouldn't have to do that, but I unfortunately do not control all hotels so I can not make them put cameras in nor can I make them properly staff their hotels. Another thing is a lot of hotels do not have a dedicated security department, if you're wondering why, the answer is always money. We make no money for the company so many hotels opt to not have security and they just take the hit when customers get stuff stolen and never come back because it costs less than staffing an entire department. So just be respectful, my post won't deter criminals, and it won't make hotels fund departments or put in the proper equipment, there's nothing I can do to change that the same way a Starbucks employee can't change the prices. If you care about security then I recommend vetting the place before staying. So be safe out there, spend the money if you want to be in a safe hotel or don't, that's your decision. I do thank you guys though, I should have added into my PSA that not all hotels have proper security, and it seems not a lot of people were aware of that the same way a lot of people are unaware just how much security some hotels do have. I might respond to some comments, but a lot of you are just saying the same thing so I decided to just make an edit instead.",hotels,276,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/17u6yoj/psa_from_hotel_security_we_can_see_yall_on_camera/

I had an incident with a hotel where I booked a one night stay. The evening I was there, I needed to extend my stay another night. I extended through their app, and received confirmation that my extension was approved immediately. The following day, I was 45 minutes away for work, and I was contacted via personal email that they dont have a reservation for me, and the hotel was sold out and needed to come get my things. I did not check that email until approximately 8 which was much later than checkout. 

I tried to call their front desk and was routed to some random person who then called the front desk. They immediately blamed me, and threatened me with charges since I still had my things in the room.

Upon arrival, I asked for an explanation, but received none other than Im not sure how you were approved for another night my computer shows you arent and you are going to be charged for it. They then handed me my things which they took from my room. Didnt even bother to pack it in to luggage, just a bunch of plastic bags. No offer to help me find another place to stay. Not only was it embarrassing, I had to leave a work event early to get back.

I dont understand how I can book through the proper channels, get a confirmation email that my stay has been extended, be evicted, and have it be my fault& has anyone had this happen before?

Hi all a bit desperate here. Will cut the story down as much as I can however: 

Had a terrible room that got worse late at night, tried to contact the host but the didnt reply so we payed for another room for the night . We had originally booked the first place for two nights but obviously didnt want to continue and asked for a refund. The host basically gaslit us and denied all or any problems and of course refused a refund. 

So then my next stage was to complain to Agoda about the host and see if they could get us a refund. We expected pained in depth what happened with photos and videos. For some reason Agoda customer service reached out to the host and asked for their opinion which is where it gets funny, the host then said we never complained and actually we partied with friends all night. Agoda then sent this to us in an email where they said the issue is now resolved. Im now emailing trying to let them know the host is lying to them and re iterating the situation, also there are other similar bad reviews on google. Agoda is now not replying to emails.

So basically am looking to see if anyone has dealt with Agoda like this and had a positive outcome? And/or does anyone have any helpful tips?",hotels,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/17p1bdp/agoda_complaints_help/

Thermostat only goes to 20C. Called for help and they reset it to 18C, which still resulted in hot air coming out - just & slightly less hot? 

Apparently there is no option for A/C or even just plain air for circulation. Thank god my room has a small balcony and a door that opens because otherwise I think I would have passed out from the heat. 

Entire hallway is HOT. Manager chose to scream at me this is winter Madam! He offered to move me to another room& which also would not have any temperature control. When I tried to explain to him that I dont believe that would solve the problem, unless he wants to concede that he put me in a broken room to start with, he hung up on me.

2023-11-01,1698880763,Budget Inn Princeton WV,"To preface this I was not looking for much with regard to overnight accommodation this particular evening. A stopover for rest so we could have a chance to see New River Gorge in the morning was all we were after.

We arrived at the Cracktel at twilight, I largely disregarded the other patrons stirring about as we checked in. At the desk we read through the typo ridden list of rules and regulations, replete with handwritten amendments, with some amusement. None were unreasonable but clearly had borne from necessity, the specificity should have been the first clue we were in for a trip. The receptionist seemed surprised by our presence despite our reservation made a few hours prior. He called up an associate on the phone, spoke in a dialect I presume was Hindi, then asked us what rate we were quoted. We answered earnestly and he took my ID, promptly photographing it with his mobile device. I again decided to ignore the growing list of red flags. He tallied a handwritten reciept, added $10 to the quote and $80.40 later, handed us a key.

We arrived at room 3, offering a nod to our fellow motel goers and immediately upon entering, began to grow concerned with our selection of temporary residence. The door had clearly been forced at some point in its lifespan. As the ancient florecent light flickered into action it revealed a room that was largely typical of what one would expect in a place aptly labeled ""The Budget Inn"". We found it interesting that the wired in smoke detector was missing and an ashtray was present on the end table,despite the multiple notices of a non smoking room detailing penalties. This was coupled with the beat-in odor of decades of stagnant smoke filled air, again triggering warning lights.

This time it was enough to cause me to video document the surroundings prior to us moving any of our baggage inside. I noted the multiple burn marks in the vanity, the non functioning bathroom door and the bathtub that had clearly been painted as evidenced by the overspray on adjacent tiles. Tiles, I may add, which were set with all of the precision one would expect from a palsy stricken chimp. All around there were signs that the room had lived a hard life; strange smears and marks decorated the walls, indicative of prior patrons bracing themselves against the ever present threat of gravity.
With proof of preexisting conditions established, we we took our place on the available seating and enjoyed some fried chicken from a local eatery. Apparently in the 25 minutes it took to settle in, we had entered the witching hour for our neighbors. The figures I aforementioned clearly had endured considerable exposure to substance in that brief period of time. The frantic activity and constant shuffling, bore bare the nature of their stay. It was quickly evident that we were surrounded by children of the rock.

I must say it was interesting to watch the progression as they descended into to deeper and deeper states of inebriation. Oddly enough, they all seemed to suddenly inherit the same walk; dipping wildly with each step, shoulders skewed out of square, arms constantly moving, as though swatting away imaginary clouds of insects.

We retreated to the relative safety of our kicked in door and began preparing the battle plan for a B&amp;E situation. Some impromptu rearrangement of furniture allowed for a barricade sufficient enough to allow for a serviceable defensive position. We cracked some beers to ready ourselves for the night ahead, saving empties as an early warning system.  We took to observing our neighbors and their compatriots meet carside only to retreat to one or the others room, before emerging again to repeat the cycle. At some point we made the mistake of sampling online reviews. After sifting through some that were clearly written by/made at the direction of management, (or perhaps written by individuals accustomed to temporary accommodations in Chernobyl) we began to realize the magnitude of our folly. Did I mention there was no hot water... good times.

By this time we became aware of our receptionist taking his position in a dueling role as parking lot enforcement agent. He strolled dutifully back and forth with a keen eye on the comings and going of the other guests, still shuffling to and from vehicles and each others rooms. As entertaining as this was, we decided it best to hunker down and weather the evening. After one more trip outside to honor or commitment to the non smoking room policy, we put our barricades in place and settled in. Sitting behind our makeshift ramparts we strategized the best way to deal with a host of potential unpleasant situations. With an action plan established for the most likely worst case scenarios, we laid back atop the provided bedding.  We laid imagining which varieties of ilicit substance were being absorbed into our flesh. The sounds of crackheads skittering past our window lulled me into a state of restfulness one typically only enjoys in a foxhole during active combat. As I drifted off, I dreamt of cluster wounds on my leg that produced long-fern like stalks, followed by a purulent exudate rife with beetles and larvae.  After that, sleep escaped me.

I went in to the budget Inn with extremely low expectations and boy did they deliver. No hot water, dirty sheets, live action entertainment, who could ask for more. To boot we noted that that our card had infact been charged for $90.40. Perhaps the extra $10 went to covering the salary ever vigilant nightwatchman.
If nothing else it was good for a tale.

So we've booked a fancy 5 star resort  hotel (500+ USD per night) and my wife had a shard of glass in her fruit salad this morning. We did not make a scene but told the chef waiter and he apologised as someone might have dropped a glass in the area of the fruits. When we left the dining area we saw that people checked the place.

However tonight at dinner the staff was somehow weird and we think they probably had trouble with the mgmt and might be angry.

On the other hand i would have at least expected an apology by someone from the management, but we did not get contacted nor any other info.

Am I overreacting or could I demand more from such an expensive place? I also do not want normal staff to take the blame as i think the management should ensure wuality and safety.

So I just arrived in a hotel in asia. I initially booked 3 nights on booking.com
Of course the room AC doesnt work (its 35 degrees humid), and when I asked to change the room, they accepted but gave me a room a stinks cigarette so I said no.

The thing is, I want to get out tomorrow and find another hotel. So tomorrow I will only pay 1 night.

The thing is I am afraid that the hotel says on booking that I didnt show up and charge me the no show up fee (first night) even though I paid for it.

What should I do ? Not pay at the counter and let them do the no show, or just pay at the counter and hope they dont charge me ?

2023-10-28,1698495929,Someones been in my hotel room while Ive been gone?,"*update at bottom 

Hi friends,
As the title states, someones been using my hotel room while my girlfriend and I are gone at work. We flew into Dallas for a business trip and are staying downtown. We came back from work last night to a long black hair in the sink (Im a redhead and shes blonde). This was odd but not immediately off the wall scary. I thought maybe house keeping had been in there? But there were no new towels or linens. 

This morning on the way out the door we discovered someone elses underwear on the shelf that was definitely not there yesterday. Really not sure what to do here, gf is pretty freaked out as am I. Were currently at work and I called the front desk (its about 7:30am as I write this) and they said a manager wouldnt be there to help me until 3:30pm. Any advice??? Very weird situation.

**UPDATE 3:19pm CT 10/28
Called the desk for the 3rd time, theyre having technical difficulties reading the log so they dont know whos been in the room. Something fishy ngl. When I got brushed off this morning, I almost had the inclination that the person knew what I was talking about but didnt care or want to get someone in trouble but I pushed that off thinking it was minimal at best but this is strange theyre now having technical difficulties. They did offer to cancel the keys, and have an escort for us to go up to the room with us before we enter again. 

**UPDATE 12:54am CT 10/29
After dealing with the front desk all day, gf and I got off work and got back to the hotel. I then informed the front desk AGAIN of the situation to which the manager on duty had no idea what I was talking about and told me this was the first she was hearing of it. This means this obviously wasnt passed up the chain of command. She appropriately freaked out and was profusely apologizing. She took us over to the bar and gave us free drinks and a new room. I really just needed someone to take this matter as seriously as we took it. It was a massive security breach and needed to be treated as such. If anyones curious we left some expensive belongings out (my AirPods, gfs ipad) in plain view and nothing was stolen. I really think that someone with a master key was fucking in our room and they just got caught. We slept in the bed afterwards though and I dont wanna think about that. Currently typing this from my new room so all good now but would love to know what ultimately happened. Stay away from the aloft Dallas downtown you have been officially warned. Thanks for all the help during this yall! Has been a very weird day and I hate knowing that the sense of security you feel with hotel rooms is false. Not sure how to unpop that bubble. 

UPDATE 11:18am CT 10/30
Hi yall this has started blowing up a little so hello to all the new people following this story. Gf and I just checked out of our new room at the Aloft Dallas Downtown. I shit you not someone tried to come into our new room this morning. I ended up running out of the room to try to get a good look at the guy who ended up being what I assume was an employee? He had an earpiece in and what looked like a work shirt? There was no knock, nothing, just straight up tried to come into the room. This guy was definitely not house keeping. After reading all of these new comments, its lead me to believe there is a prostitution ring going on and this guy was part of the lookout linguists squad. We talked to the front desk again this morning and got the GMs number. Front desk said they would check back in with the engineering team and try to look at the log again. Absolutely going to send this up the chain of command at Marriott. ALOFT DALLAS DOWNTOWN IS NOT SAFE. 

UPDATE: 12:34pm CT 10/30 
Just left the GM a voicemail. Will update with what happens. Im expecting at least a free night or two. At the very least an accurate answer of who went in the room. 

UPDATE 10:11pm CT 10/31
I spoke with the GM yesterday afternoon who assured me hes looking into it. He said they he took the engineer up to the room and confirmed that when a key is scanned it doesnt register? Hes submitted a ticket to get it fixed. In the absence of this he also stated that they dont have surveillance cameras in the hallway so at the moment until the engineer team fix the log system theres no way of knowing who was in the room. He did encourage me to submit a police report which makes me think he doesnt know of anything going on. Ill be submitting a police report tomorrow morning and will keep yall updated. My gf and I have taken in yalls comments and will absolutely be purchasing a ring/pet camera for our rooms for future use when we travel which is often. 

UPDATE 6:20pm CT 11/1
I spoke with the GM again today. He offered us 60,000 points (two free nights) for our troubles. He said they have to take the lock to their testing facility since they cant retrieve any information from it and told me theres a good chance hell now have to have someone come out and look at all the locks in the property. I asked if hes ever experienced something like this to which he said he hadnt. He said sometimes the wires dont work and cause issues but they replace them and no biggie but never this. Truly curious if we uncovered something here. I bought a security camera to take with me for work as we leave again on Saturday. Submitting the police report tonight / tomorrow and will update.

L'hôtellerie est un élément clé de la stratégie des casinos, car elle permet aux clients de séjourner sur place et de profiter de tous les divertissements et des activités du casino, et de fait, permet :  


Augmentation des revenus : L'hôtellerie peut générer des revenus importants pour les casinos, provenant des chambres, des restaurants, des bars et des autres services.  


Amélioration de la marge bénéficiaire : L'hôtellerie a généralement une marge bénéficiaire plus élevée que les jeux de hasard.  


Diversification des revenus : L'hôtellerie permet aux casinos de diversifier leurs sources de revenus, ce qui les rend moins vulnérables aux fluctuations du marché des jeux de hasard.  


Cependant, même si la partie hôtelière représente une belle opportunité pour les casinos, elle représente quand même un défi pour ceux-ci, comme :  


Investissement initial élevé : La construction ou l'acquisition d'un hôtel peut nécessiter un investissement initial important.  


Coûts d'exploitation élevés : L'exploitation d'un hôtel est coûteuse, en raison des salaires, des fournitures et des services.  


Compétition accrue : Le marché de l'hôtellerie est très concurrentiel, ce qui peut rendre difficile la différenciation des casinos.

For reference, I was staying at a hotel that falls somewhere in between standard and luxury, but leaning more towards the standard side, with decent amenities. The situation arose when I requested a brief service  I asked for the floors to be quickly cleaned due to a sighting of a cockroach in an otherwise legitimately clean room (I have high standards and I would stay here again so it wasnt a huge deal), along with a request for some additional towels and coffee. This interaction left me perplexed when I tried to offer a tip. Is this a common situation, and are there specific circumstances where its inappropriate for them to accept tips? I researched and understood it is customary to tip daily which is also why Im confused. Also where should you leave a tip? Starting to think that it actually is awkward and would be better if there was an envelope for tip or none at all (or included in total fee) since asking someone to take loose cash if youre not there is not an ideal precedent in my opinion.

just wanted to see if this has happened to anyone else. im here for a three day conference. so three night stay. day 1, i come back to my room for lunch and cant get in. i go to the front desk and they said i checked out. i did not. the lady says that because i apparently had checked out, when someone checked in shortly after, the computer system said my room was empty and assigned them to my room. the person went back to the front desk shortly after and said that someones stuff was in their room (my room). they said i had been reassigned to a different room. never was notified about any of this. they say sorry for the inconvenience and fix my card so i can get back in. 

day 2 (today). i get an email saying thanks for your stay! with a receipt for two nights,  but i still have one night here. i leave the conference to go back to the hotel and ¡surprise! i have been checked out again. no one is staying with me that couldve checked me out. the front desk doesnt know whats going on but they fix my card again so i can get in. 

im just very confused as to how this has happened twice. i had a reservation at this hotel for a three night stay. the company i work for paid for it, so there is no payment issue. the staff at the front desk seemed just as confused as i am. thank god the lady who was assigned to my room yesterday was an honest person and didnt take any of my stuff, but its so worrying to me that they let someone into my room where all of my things are, and that this has now happened twice.",hotels,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/179zl39/hyatt_place_new_orleans/

2023-12-02,1701552148,Bait and switch by Le Blanc Los Cabos,"I am wondering if anyone has been in this position. Very disappointed in this whole process. I am co planning my best friends bachelorette trip and we fell in love with Le Blanc from hearing about it from a friend. I went to their website to book the reservation. The room with 2 queen beds had a great price so we booked it. We made reservations for 2 rooms for all 7 of us girls. Even called to request rooms next to each other since they didnt have an option for connecting rooms. Cut to, a friend mentions our deal is very good for the hotel. Confused I double checked the website and the price still showed online so whats the issue? Well many hotel websites will default to 2 people per room which Le Blancs website did as well. I started reading about all inclusive hotels and how they charge per person and not per room. The website mentions that this room in particular is 4 people max. Sounds great we would have 4 girls in one room and 3 in the other. Easy. Well, without any warning on the website before booking there is no mention of price per person. It only says that 4 people are allowed in the room max. Then I went back to the page and changed the drop down menu to 4 people then nothing happened and price remained the same. I was dumbfounded. After more days of perusing the website I noticed there is a lightly colored button underneath the amount of people in the room that says update. Seriously? Sure enough I hit the button for 4 people and then hit update and voila! Now the price changes making it $524 MORE per person for the room of 4 girls. Exorbitant. Excuse me? I am still in shock that this hotel has the audacity to not post the PRICE on the reservation is correlated to the amount of PEOPLE per room. My friends fiancé is an attorney and read the terms and conditions of their website and he agreed they do not have anything stating this to anyone when booking. I read the terms and conditions as well and it is all about their data and how they share it with other third parties. Shady, but no mention of price per person not per room. I spoke with my friend who is the bride and both stunned she said when were they going to tell us this? We have both never stayed at an all inclusive hotel. We imagined that there would be no warning of this and they planned to tell us when we checked in and had no choice but to pay because the cancellation window would have already passed. After doing a deeper dive into other all inclusive hotels to see how they do it I do see a price change per person however other hotel websites specify on their website that the price of the hotel room may change based based on number of occupants. Nowhere on Le Blancs website does it say that. It is intentionally misleading and Im guessing they bank on people making the same mistake we did. The old bait and switch. Its a stunning resort. Wonder how much of their profit from essentially tricking guests has been used to make it look so upscale and offer amazing services like free airport transfer. Which btw that is not free. It is included only if you stay for 4 nights or longer. But there you go, par for the course of an underhanded hotel. I am wondering if there are grounds to sue for this. Possible class action?

My wife and I are hoping to book a holiday to Tulum, Mexico and have found this hotel called VR CLUB Tulum Riviera. 

It looks really nice and has everything we're after, the only problem is, it has hardly any reviews! Also on some websites it is described as 5 star and on others 3 star.

Is there any chance it is a scam? Or could it just be a new hotel? 

Any investigatory skills appreciated!

I have recently started a hotel business, and while things are going well for the time being, I want to ensure, by using marketing, that the little restaurant that I have built indoors, does well too.

As a result, could someone tell me, what the terms and conditions of a sample marketing deal between a hotel, and an external restaurant can be like?

2023-11-19,1700417926,"PSA to hotel guests, from a Front Desk Agent","I work as a FDA at Big Corporate Hotel"" and these are some things that I wish guests knew when booking. 

Hotel Membership Benefits: Upgrades, early check-ins, late check-outs, specific room requests  these are never guaranteed. It is all based upon what the availability is. And sometimes it just is not available. 

Upgrades: If the hotel is at 100% capacity, we literally do not have an upgraded room to give to you. If you needed the room upgrade, then that is what you should have booked, otherwise you are just banking on getting lucky that something is available.

Late checkouts: the hotel I work at only offers late checkouts up to a certain time and for a certain amount of rooms, and cannot go past it unless we charge another full night, because we would have to put the room out of order. I know that other hotels work differently, but general rule of thumb is that if a hotel is not able to give you a late checkout, its not because they just dont feel like it, its because there is a limited amount of housekeeping and rooms that need to be ready at check-in time.
Think about coming to a hotel to check-in, and your room still isnt clean 3 hours after check-in time because 50% of the guests the night before want to try to leave at 4pm. It just isnt possible sometimes.

Early check-ins: If we were super booked the night before, it takes awhile for rooms to get turned over. If youre trying to check in at 10am when the hotel checkout time isnt even until 11am, its just not going to be possible unless there were maybe clean, empty rooms the night before.
(On that note, if you decide to go perusing the hallways and harassing our housekeepers to get a room ready for you before check-in time, you will be DNRd from the hotel).

Specific room requests: That is exactly what they are, requests. Not guarantees. (Not talking about accessibility rooms  if you booked that, you will not be suddenly moved into a non-acc. room if you have a disability. Solely talking about requests for leisure purposes). You specifically wanted 415? Someone smoked in the room the night before, the A/C broke, we had to move someone from another room, etc. You specifically wanted to be on the top floor? We suddenly hit full capacity the night before, and everyone on that floor happens to be staying for 3+ days so we wont have any rooms on that floor available. Sometimes things happen, and its not that we dont try our best to make sure we can get you what you want, but it just isnt possible. 

Third-parties: Dont recommend using them. Book directly with the hotel, whether that be on their online website or calling the hotel. Beware that 3rd parties are sneaky and will sometimes appear to be the actual hotel website, but will channel you through to their own booking sites. Sometimes it may appear as though youre saving money, but at the end of the day youre paying about the same amount in fees/etc. to the 3rd party, rather than just paying directly with the hotel which gives you much more flexibility with your reservation. When you book with a 3rd party and anything goes wrong with your stay (accidentally booked wrong dates, need to cancel reservation, something went wrong at the hotel and need compensation for your stay), the hotel is really not able to do anything as the 3rd party is the one holding your reservation and money, not us. And 3rd parties are notorious for not having great customer service, and also will not give you your money back.  
Also, if you are a hotel rewards member and book through a 3rd party, you will not be able to receive your membership benefits. You have to book directly with the hotel to get membership benefits. 

Credit Card Membership Programs: Some credit card companies give special offers for hotel membership upgrades/points/etc. for signing up for their CC. Thats all fine and good, but they have many underlying rules  for example, if you signed up for a CC to get elevated hotel membership status, you can either book a hotel room through the credit card company to get your bonus credit card points, OR book directly with the hotel to get your hotel membership benefits. You will not get both the credit card points &amp; hotel benefits, its either one or the other.

At the end of the day, all I want as a FDA is to make every single guest happy. I will go out of my way to make sure that you have the best experience possible, but sometimes it just isnt possible to give everyone what they want all the time. Please be as flexible and understanding as you can, and BE KIND.

2023-11-18,1700322011,Luggage stolen from hotel storage room,"I am staying at a four-star hotel in NYC (edit: NH Collection NY Madison Ave). The morning I arrived, I dropped my bag off for luggage storage, which they took and gave me a printed luggage tag (with a number and the hotel's logo) to retrieve it. When I came back that evening to check in and get my bag (with the physical luggage tag), I was informed that someone came to the hotel a few hours prior with a photo of my luggage tag, so they gave him the bag and he left with it (in a Mercedes, which is not a car where my old beat-up duffel bag belongs). They even showed me the security video of the interaction. Although you can't see the photo in the security video, the bellman swears it was the correct number. This does not seem to be a simple confusion of bags -- if it was, there would be an extra bag left over at the end of the day, which they say was not the case.

What power do I have here to get compensated? Although the front desk manager seems kind and helpful, whoever is his manager claims they will not compensate me / are not responsible for this. They also seem to be dragging their feet filing a police report (this happened 2 days ago and still waiting to get this done).

Any theories on how this could have happened? If this was a regular bag-stealing situation at a train station, I would be annoyed but not worried. This, however, seems somehow creepy, personal, and violating. I did take a photo of the luggage tag, but had both the tag in my wallet and my phone with me all day, so unless someone stole and replaced my wallet, or hacked my phone, there is no way they would have the photo.

EDIT: To clarify, they did not take my ID/name/info when I gave them the bag. They just gave me a tag with an (allegedly) unique number and put another tag with the same number on my bag so that they could match the numbers when I (or, in this case, anyone) came to pick up the bag.

EDIT 2: Filed the police report myself. The front desk manager had promised to do it but kept saying they took too long to get here yesterday and the day before, (allegedly) arriving at 4am and 1:30am. (When I called myself, police were there within 10 minutes...) Calling corporate office once I have the report number.

EDIT 3: The hotel says they got in touch with the person who walked out with my bag and are mailing it back to me (in the slowest possible manner). They claim it was a mistake on the bellman's part, although when I spoke to him (and the police spoke to him), he swore he could not have possibly mixed up the bag because the luggage tag was a single-digit number while all the others were four-digit numbers. This still doesn't add up because a bag mix-up would mean that there would be a bag left over at the end of the day. Regardless of whether this was a screw-up that they refuse to properly explain to me, or something nefarious, this situation was and continues to be handled in an exceedingly incompetent manner, so I'm posting it here so that you can avoid staying there:

2023-11-16,1700125831,Choice hotels / Priceline ripped me off. Who do I complain to?,"Through a confluence of bad luck and lack of planning, I found myself stuck in Anchorage for the night last night without my credit cards (stolen) and only one debit card, which had roughly $300 in the account. I booked a room at the Clarion through Priceline for a hundred bucks, leaving a little under two hundred in the account. Per the terms, the hotel takes a $150 deposit.

When I arrived to check in, the front desk tried repeatedly to run my card for the deposit, and it kept declining. They refused to let me pay it in cash, and wouldn't refund me either - I was left with nowhere to stay, in November, in Alaska. I called Priceline, who jerked me around for ninety minutes, and finally determined that the FD was trying to run my card for $250, not the $150 in the terms and conditions. They called the hotel, and extracted a promise to do it correctly and get me checked in. 

Go back inside, they run my debit card for the $150, leaving less than ten bucks in my account. A minute later, she announced that they don't accept cards from my bank (even though they'd already charged my card) and refused to check me in. They also refused to refund me either the deposit or the room, leaving me stuck out in the cold. 

I'm pissed, and I can't seem to get anyone to even refund me the money for the room. Priceline says only the hotel can do it; the hotel says Priceline alone can do it.

2023-11-15,1700059148,Exigeons la transparence et l'équité d'Agoda.com en France,"Bonjour à toutes et à tous !

Je me suis récemment fait escroquer par agoda.fr (qui redirige vers agoda.com) et j'ai décidé de ne pas rester les bras croisés. Pour être totalement honnête, étudiant en droit, j'ai vu cela comme une opportunité de m'exercer. Cependant, au fil du temps, j'ai réalisé qu'il y avait vraiment quelque chose à entreprendre, non seulement pour moi, mais surtout pour les autres !

Il suffit de rechercher Agoda pour constater le nombre incroyable de plaintes en ligne ! Voici ce que j'ai déjà entrepris, ce que je suis en train de faire et ce que je compte faire dans un avenir proche. J'espère que ce partage aidera beaucoup d'autres :

1. J'ai tenté une médiation écrite avec Agoda, mais sans résultats. En fait, leur désintérêt est significatif et plutôt ironique.
2. J'ai immédiatement demandé à ma banque un chargeback, ce qui bloque le paiement.

À ce stade, je voulais engager une action en justice au tribunal judiciaire pour affaires civiles. Il est important de comprendre qu'Agoda est en réalité une société étrangère opérant en France, sans adresse physique en France. Pour un avocat ordinaire, cela signifie l'impossibilité de déposer un dossier.

3. J'ai donc examiné leurs statuts et j'ai découvert qu'ils ont un Siret et Siren, ainsi qu'un enregistrement au RNE, mais avec un statut incorrect, sans adresse ni dirigeant.
4. J'ai contacté Signal Conso, qui m'a redirigé vers leur service départemental (pour info, Signal Conso est vraiment formidable).
5. Ce service départemental a enregistré ma plainte et mène actuellement une enquête.

Cependant, pour maximiser mes chances, j'ai également examiné leurs taxes. Bien que ma facture avec eux indique ma résidence en France, il n'y a pas de TVA française sur celle-ci.
6. J'ai donc suspecté une évasion fiscale et informé le fisc (quel parcours du combattant pour les contacter). Le fisc a reçu ma plainte et j'attends leur retour.

En attendant je me suis rendu compte qu'agoda ne respectais pas les recommandations de IATA et les obligations légales d'un voyagiste qui sont regits en France par le code du commerce.

A ce point une rapide recherche internet de français étant désespérés car dans l'impossibilité de se faire entendre en justice et de se faire rembourser (agoda entre temps à en effet trouvé une escuse fallacieuse pour que mon chargeback soit inversé, ce qui me couta encore plus) 

Je me suis rendu aussi compte qu'une pétition, nommée"" Exigeons la transparence et l'équité d'Agoda.com en France"" existait depuis quelques heure ici  https://chng.it/fHrrkz4vkY ou tapez simplement google change.org agoda.com en France 

Voilà pour ce que j'ai fait. 

pour ce que je fais maintenant:
1. Je recherche des soutien et des victimes francophones d'Agoda pour une éventuelle action en justice en commun.
2. J'ai trouvé un moyen de poursuivre agoda en Justice: article 44 du code de procédure civile. Mais est ce du civil ou du pénal ?(escroquerie caractérisé et repetée) J'étudie la question 
3. J'ai informé agoda des lois qu'ils enfreingnent en France et leur ai laissé la chance de s'expliquer. 

Voilà ce que je vais faire
1. Dès décembre je déposerai une requête au Tribunal judiciaire (ou TP?) et demanderai justice, je demanderai à ce que le procès soit publique, afin que celui ci puisse bénéficier au la communauté. 

Merci à tous !

2023-11-15,1700054560,A.I is slowly ruining my writing career; I am now looking for jobs in hotels. Please help.,"I am 30 yrs old who dropped out of pursuing bachelors in hotel management in 2017 due to health issues and also because I took an interest in writing. I learned how to write fairly well. I wouldnt say I am best at it currently but I secured a good content writing job in an advertising agency and Ive been doing that job for the last 5 years until the disruptive presence of AI.   
  
In just a single year, my company has lost major clients because they all prefer AI now since it is more efficient and faster. with the speed at which we are losing clients, I belief I will be getting unemployed in the next year or so. I regret quitting my hotel management program. However, had I known that AI will be disrupting the writing market, I wouldnt have chosen it at the first place.   
  
Creative and technical writing still has impressive scope but Ive another reason for quitting writing and choosing a job in hotels. 

I am developing sciatica and my doctor warned that any desk job will deteriorate my back pain condition and possibly make it irreversible. He recommended choosing a career where I dont have to sit for longer period, and any job in the hospitality industry seems to be an effective option.   


Anyway, I just want to inquire whether I can secure a job in the hotel industry as an absolute fresher. which type of hotel jobs are feasible for my current state? will my growing age be a cause for concern?  as mentioned, I am 30 now.   
  
Any advice will be highly appreciated.
