2023-10-23,1698021399,Secondary Parvo exposure& How to best clean clothes?,"Hey there. 
I have two 3-ish month old puppies who have had two rounds of Spectra5 - An adult dog at my office contracted a near lethal case of Parvo, but we didnt know about it until Wednesday the 18th, with the dog not showing symptoms until the day before on Tuesday/17th. I said hello to the dog and let it jump on me on last Thursday, the 12th. 

All shoes have been bleached and doused with Kennelsol, as well as the surfaces that were walked upon. All my blankets and floors have also been thoroughly disinfected, but I dont know what to do with my clothes! 

When I got home that Thursday/12th, I had to change clothes anyway because one of the pups had a big accident in her crate, so I stripped and threw my stuff in a hamper and was handling bleach anyway. Ive had that hamper quarantined in my garage, and washed the contents twice with very hot water& I used a little bit of bleach but not a ton as the clothing was all black. 

Whats the suggested method of disinfection here? Run it again on high heat? Dilute some Kennelsol in there? Put it into the dryer with the antibacterial setting?

Thank you so much!",dogs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17e7ths/secondary_parvo_exposure_how_to_best_clean_clothes/
2023-10-23,1698074983,My rescue dog is biting my brother and sister,"So I recently took in an abandoned dog but because I live in a apartment it stays with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad and I are experienced with dogs, he used to be a dog handler while he was in the army and we had multiple dogs during my growing up. The problem with this one is that it goes only for my brother (2) and my sister (4). Thats the first time we see a behaviour like this. And weve had her for 2 weeks now, she is biting them only on their arms. She doesnt respond to any training methods we know.

Around 3am yesterday, I smelled something slightly foul wafting up from downstairs. I got up curiously, put on some pants, went downstairs, and my day was ruined.

My dog had pooped on the kitchen floor. The vacuum robot had intercepted the poop and spread it everywhere - the living room, my office, the kids' playroom, etc. My dog had then apparently followed the Roomba and rolled in the poop trail all along the way. 

I was still half asleep, so it took me a while to fully comprehend what had happened. I just stood there staring at my shit-caked house while my shit-caked dog was wagging his tail, happy to unexpectedly see me when I'd normally be sleeping.

I spent basically all of the daylight hours cleaning this house today, and I still don't feel like I got it all. I also took him to one of those places with tubs where you bathe your dog and don't get dog hair all over your own bathtub. Did I mention that he's almost 100 lbs and hates baths? Ever wrangled a stubborn shit-covered giant dog into a bathtub in public? That was also part of my day today.

I'm not going to tell anyone in my real life about this, because it's fucking disgusting and I don't want them associating my house with that image. So... Sorry reddit, I'm dumping this on you.",dogs,436,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17edy3o/my_dog_did_something_disgusting_and_i_dont_want/

2023-10-23,1698072738,Is the Chihuahua or Miniature Dachshund a better choice for me?,"I recently posted about my dilemma between Chihuahuas and Miniature Dachshunds and received some really valuable responses. While I'm quite certain that I want to choose one of these two breeds, I was hoping for further feedback on which one aligns better with my lifestyle.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have previous experience owning and training family dogs, but this will be the first dog I will have sole responsibility for. I've had the opportunity to walk dogs, which has allowed me to interact with a wide range of breeds, including toy breeds and hounds.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

I prefer choosing a reputable breeder because I would like to have a good understanding of the dog's history, but if an opportunity to rescue a Chihuahua or Dachshund occurred, I would consider it.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

I'm in search of a small breed with moderate energy levels that can comfortably adapt to a small living space. Furthermore, I'm looking for a dog that will develop a strong bond with me and actively engage in interaction and companionship.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I'm interested in the Chihuahua and Miniature Dachshund. It seems that both breeds meet a lot of my requirements, and I love their curious and alert personalities. Their adaptability regarding energy levels is also a plus. However, when it comes to Miniature Dachshunds, I'm cautious about the potential risk of IVDD as that seems to be a big issue within the breed.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I plan to focus on teaching the basics like sit, down, stay, come, and so on.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm fully committed to dedicating as much time as necessary to care for and train this dog.

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I can commit to around 60-90 minutes of daily exercise, mainly involving walks and activities like fetch.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I think Ill opt for the smooth coat variety of the breed I choose as I'd like to avoid high grooming needs.

**Personal Preferences**

10. What size dog are you looking for?

Small

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I'm prepared to handle barking, slobber, and shedding. From my understanding, both Chihuahuas and Dachshunds can be pretty vocal, which I don't mind. However, I'm curious if this is more of a nature or nurture matter - Can training effectively reduce barking behaviour in these breeds?

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I dont mind. Whatever the dog is comfortable with.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

I'm okay with an independent dog, but some level of engagement would be nice.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'm fine with some alert barking.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'm fine with my dog being independent and not necessarily seeking interaction with other dogs, but I want to avoid any aggression issues.

17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

No.

**Lifestyle**

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

No more than an hour.

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

They dont have any additional preferences.

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We have a cat, but have no intentions of adding any other animals.

21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Young family members occasionally visit, but aside from that, not really.

22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No.

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

There are a few banned breeds here in the UK, but I have no interest in owning them.

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winter - 1°C to 7°C (34°F to 45°F)

Summer - 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F)

I am somewhat concerned about the sensitivity of both Chihuahuas and Dachshunds to cold weather, especially when it comes to toilet-training. I would prefer to avoid using puppy-pads if possible.",dogs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17em8je/is_the_chihuahua_or_miniature_dachshund_a_better/

2023-10-23,1698063571,Medium size and energy breed recommendation!,"Introduction  
Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\- No, we have a 3 year old rescue boxer/lab/husky that we've taken to obedience school and continued to try to implement the lessons from that school.  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?  
\- Reputable breeder  
Describe your ideal dog.  
\- An ideal dog for us is medium sized and medium energy needs. Enough to play with current dog and run in the yard and a couple of walks throughout the day, but also happy to relax on the couch in between. It would be preferable if it had a coat that was relatively easy to care for, brushing is no problem, but would prefer not to need to take it to the groomer. Bonus points if it's biddable, we've struggled with current dog to teach anything beyond the basics. We would prefer if the dog was rather quiet, barking on occassion but not for everything.   
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\- We've looked at some breeds but all seem to be missing something or have too much energy. We've researched Tollers, Welsh Springers, Brittanies, Australian Shepherds, and of course Golden and Labrador Retrievers among others.  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\- As mentioned above it would be ideal to easily train basic commands and recall, but also fetch, hide/seek games, and be able to attend advanced obedience trainings  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\- I personally would love to be able to try agility or herding (but herding breeds probably aren't right for us based on some basic research/reputation)  
Care Commitments  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\- 4 hours is probably our limit  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
\- A couple of hours of walks and play time in our garden. Additional hikes and adventures on the weekends.  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\- Minimal grooming needs would be prefered. I would be happy to brush daily/weekly and clean ears. Hair cuts are not something we'd like to deal with either ourselves or with a groomer.  
Personal Preferences  
10) What size dog are you looking for?  
\- Medium. 30-60 pounds, 20-24 inches would be ideal but this is certainly flexible.  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\- Shedding is no issue. Barking would ideally be kept to a minimum (delivery people, strangers, etc all fine to bark at). Slobber isn't a concern.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\- This is fairly important to us, we'd be devoting a lot of time to training recall.   
Dog Personality and Behavior  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\- Some personal space is fine by us, but not completely aloof. We love when our current dog decides she wants to cuddle with us. The fact she doesn't do it all the time makes it more special.  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
Again, a happy medium would be ideal. We worry a dog that's completely focused on us wouldn't be happy during the day. I work from home, but am often in meetings where it would need to entertain itself with our current dog.  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
\- Some alert barking is okay, with generally aloofness when we accept the visitors in.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\- No, we're trying to avoid dog aggressive breeds.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\- Biting as an adolescent/adult  
Lifestyle  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\- Minimally, I work from home. We occassionally go out for dinner without our dog but that's limited to up to 2 times a week maximum. Otherwise we take our dog everywhere we can.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  
\- Wife and I completely coordinating and by and large in agreement on needs thankfully!  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
\- We have one 3-year-old boxer/gsd/husky  rescue. We would ideally get chickens or ducks in the next few years.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\- Hopefully. We have no children now but they are in the plans for the next few years.  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\- We currently rent, no restrictions.  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\- I don't believe there are any applicable.  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\- Summers are low 80s average, peaking in the high 90s on occassion. Winters are cold and snowy.  
Additional Information and Questions  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.  
\- Thanks for taking the time to help.

2023-10-23,1698036582,"Living with very affectionate dog, but feel anxious around dogs - advice for how to discourage some behaviours?","I've been renting a place for the past year with a friend who has a dog. I don't feel very comfortable around dogs (had one try to attack me as a kid, no permanent injuries but I do get a bit stressed around them now) so I made clear from day 1 I wanted very little to do with the dog. I trusted the dog's owner and my other roommate, who loves dogs, to know what to do. I've helped out a couple times (taken her on a couple walks, played fetch in the backyard a few times) but otherwise besides the occasional pat I have not been involved in her life at all.  


It's now been nearly one year since we got her, and while her behaviour isn't awful, she's still a bit poorly behaved, and since I'm not a dog person I don't know if this is normal behaviour for a dog of her age. She'll try and bite my hand to get my attention if I'm trying to work on stuff, and she'll try and greet me by jumping on me - neither of which I particularly enjoy. It's not helped by the fact she's actually quite a large dog, so she's fully knocked me backwards a couple times, and nearly broken my laptop a few times too. She's also quite loud and barks a lot to try and get my attention and to try and get me to spend time with her. She's very energetic, so she'll try and bark at my window to get me to play with her at 11 or midnight (assuming her owner's still out at work), while I'm trying to get some sleep or study for uni exams! It's gotten to the point I'll actively avoid going home as long as possible some days to try and avoid her - which sucks because she's otherwise a very sweet dog, but she just puts me on edge!  


I've never had a dog before, and I'll be living with this one for the next two years most likely, so I guess I want to know if this behaviour will calm down with age, or if there's anything I can do to try and get her to stop biting, barking, jumping on me, or just help her sleep at night. If this is normal for her age, any tips for how to get less anxious around dogs? Or, worst case scenario, advice on how to get her to just ignore me in the house?  
Thanks for any advice! And sorry I'm not much of a dog person - I'm certain all of your pets are absolutely lovely &lt;3 ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17echkr/living_with_very_affectionate_dog_but_feel/
2023-10-23,1698028877,Treat dispensing toy,"Hello Everyone! 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a good/sturdy treat dispensing toy. I purchased the Pet Zone IQ treat ball off of Amazon and it worked great the first 2 uses but unfortunately the design of the top half allows for the dome to split in two. My dog is only 9lbs and was somehow able to break this toy. She loved the toy and i love how busy it kept her. I was looking for similar toys on amazon but it seems a lot of them share similar reviews of low quality. So im seeking the advice of you all! Please if anyone has any recommendations to any stimulating toys, i would be glad to look into them! 

Thanks :-)",dogs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ea8mm/treat_dispensing_toy/
2023-10-23,1698025738,Tips on how to face my friend's nervous dog?,"As the title says. 
   
Though I guess I should explain the situation more: 
About three months ago I made a new friend. We've been hanging out nonstop ever since we met for the first time, and we call each other best friends. There is nothing we keep from each other - except one thing: My friend's dog, whom I'll call Milo for the sake of this story. 
Milo is a Rough Collie (aka Long-Haired Collie) and he's around 8 years old. He has some sort of health problems that he gets medicated for, but otherwise he's quite a healthy and friendly dog who enjoys walks in the local parks with other dogs and their owners. 
      
Despite usually being an approachable little ball of fur Milo does have some aggression inside of him, which the local vet believes comes from a pain in his hip - which is one of the things he gets medicated for. The pain doesn't appear to be too serious, which is why they are currently keeping track of Milo's health to see if he needs a surgery or something. 
Anyway. 
Milo gets super nervous with new people and barks at them a lot. My friend, whom I'll refer to as John, says Milo has never attacked anyone, but people get anxious around him if he happens to become defensive. (This never happens at parks where there are other dogs etc, it happens only when they are by themselves, like for a walk around the neighborhood.) 
What makes it harder to help Milo learn other people aren't a danger to him is the fact John hasn't had a single friend for the past ten years. Not before me. So all the people Milo knows are John's family members and relatives, and since he's known them his entire life he doesn't have this kind of behavior with them. 
     
John told me that because I've become an important part of his life he would love for me to meet Milo, the love of his life. And I would love to! I love dogs! But John also said he's nervous about the first meeting because he can't predict how Milo will react to me. 
I'm not afraid of barking dogs, but I would love to learn how to make the first meeting as safe and stressless as possible for both John and Milo. I would like to know how to act and be so Milo would feel safe with me. 
 
Pretty much the only thing I know is to stay calm, keep distance if Milo needs it and take all the time he needs. 
 
But is there something more I could do? 
John isn't much of a help here because this situation is new for him, too. The only thing he can do is to tell me about Milo as much as possible before we meet, but otherwise... Yeah.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17e985g/tips_on_how_to_face_my_friends_nervous_dog/

I did want to ask, though, if anyone had advice for care for a vision impaired dog.

She was originally a street dog from Romania but she has been with for over 9 years. Just over 2 weeks ago we lost her brother. We are all devastated and grieving terribly. Ebony is a very easy going girl and I won't lie, because her brother (a border collie) had a strong personality and very clear exercise and attention needs. I think I concentrated on meeting his needs and Ebony just came along for the ride. Now hes gone and I want to make the rest of her life as amazing as possible. Now to the problem, I don't have many ideas what to do. Ebony is 10ish, she is 10kg/22lbs, she is diabetic so meals have to be strict, with no treats or meals in-between. Ebony doesn't enjoy toys. She does like her cat laser which we play with. She has at least 2.5hrs of exercise a day. At least 1hr is off lead. I try to go to different places. Her on lead street walks I let her choose the route we take and she can stop and sniff as much as she wants, as I believe it her time. She already knows quite a few tricks/commands. I try to take her into dog friendly shop eg pet shops, garden centres etc as she enjoys them but obviously we can't do that everyday. I worried she's lonely and unhappy.

2023-10-22,1697973058,Breed recommendations please!,"***Introduction***  
  
1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I currently own a 2.5 year old Poodle mix. He was an owner rehome who I got about 1.5 years ago - trained him through some pretty severe separation anxiety (which was very much a struggle at the time but glad we've made it out the other end)!   
  
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? 

Preferring to go through a reputable breeder. Would actually prefer an adult dog who has a known temperament (I hear those puppy blues are a b\*tch!).   
  
3. Describe your ideal dog.

Prefer a small-medium breed dog (probably max out around the 15kg mark). I currently own a dog and an 8 year old cat who play together all the time, so an adaptable dog with low prey drive! Low shedding and low barking as my cat sheds enough for the lot of us and I will potentially be living in an apartment! A dog who is happy to go-go-go when we are out on the weekends, but happy to be a couch potato during the work day. No separation anxiety (worked my way through that once with my current dog and it's not something I'm keen on doing again!). I'd also love a dog who loves swimming/water!   
  
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\- Goldens (Pros: generally friendly breed, recommended for beginners, has an off switch. Cons: larger size and concerned about weight restrictions in apartments) 

\- NSDTR (Pros: pocket rocket, drive to go. Cons: can be an anxious/nervous breed, higher energy, Toller scream lol) 

\- Standard poodles (Pros: very smart breed, has an off switch, very low shedding. Cons: similar to goldens - concerns about weight restrictions in apartments)

\- Whippet (Pros: beautiful apartment dogs, off switch, pretty happy-go-lucky, couch potato after sufficient exercise. Cons: concerned about generally anxious nature of whippets, prey drive with my current cat)

\- Cocker spaniels (Pros: good size, trainable, OK energy requirements Cons: EAR INFECTIONS CENTRAL!!!!!)   
  
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Nothing too extreme, would just be the general basic obedience (sit, stay, place, off switch, recall etc.).   
  
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Potentially considering agility or scentwork as I think my dog at the moment would also enjoy, but not a necessity/guarantee!   
  
***Care Commitments***  
  
7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

Obviously understanding that a puppy requires high attention, however, following probably about a year-old, would want to integrate the dog into my current dogs routine. Training-wise I usually do at least a 15-20 minute training session with my dog a day. Playing is ad hoc as my dog requests. I work from home and will be continuing to do so (at least while I am in my current job and I see no plans to change anytime soon!) so interaction is also plentiful throughout the day!  
  
8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

As above, hoping to integrate with my dog's current routine, which is usually 3-4x walks during the work week (about 45 mins each) and one long outing on the weekends (varies from dog beach, 4-5km hikes etc.). I do take my current dog to the dog park, but this is sparingly and only once I've driven past and see that there are no dogs there.   
  
9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

Very happy to do regular grooming. My current dog is a Poodle mix and I've learnt to do all of his grooming at home and have all of the equipment (fortnightly bath, full groom every 6 weeks, nails done weekly).   
  
***Personal Preferences***  
  
10. What size dog are you looking for? 

Small to medium size (max around 15kg) - based on general apartment size restrictions I've seen).   
  
11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

Low to medium shedding, minimal barking and minimal slobber.   
  
12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Very! A lot of the parks I go to with my dog now are off-leash and unfenced.   
  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
  
13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

Open to either, my current dog is a snuggler so not too fussed if my next dog is one that prefers their own space.   
  
14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please? 

Generally biddable.   
  
15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

Prefer more on the aloof side!   
  
16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

No - currently have a dog and a cat already, and not something I'm willing to manage.   
  
17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid? 

Definitely separation anxiety! My current dog also has a plethora of general health issues (pretty sure he was byb) so would like a generally hardy dog (for reference, my dog has a sensitive stomach (lots of bouts of inappetence, diarrhoea etc.), recurring ear infections, anal gland issues - he's been to the vet more times in the 1.5 years I've had him than some dogs go in a lifetime!).   
  
***Lifestyle***  
  
18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

Working from home so not often during the work week, but would like them to be able to manage being left up to 5/6 hours on the weekends when necessary.   
  
19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

N/A - live alone.   
  
20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

Yes - 1 dog (poodle mix, 2.5 years, 7kg) and 1 cat (chonky stray cat, 8 years old, 6kg).   
  
21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

Not at the moment, but likely as friends are starting to talk about having children.   
  
22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No - own my house now and looking to buy an apartment in the near future. I believe the standard breed restrictions for Australia apply (pit/bullies, Japanese tosas, Dogo Argentino etc.) and most apartments also have weight restrictions (most are under 10kg, I've seen a couple with 15kg).   
  
23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Australia - breed restrictions include American pitbulls or pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, Dogo Argentinio, Fila Brasiliero etc.   
  
24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

Average day in the summer is probably around 25 degrees Celsius, winter average gets to about 10 degrees Celsius. It can also hit temperatures above 40 degrees in summer so definitely want a dog that can tolerate heat!   
  
***Additional Information and Questions***  
  
25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I'm not looking to get a dog until likely 3-4 years time, so hoping for some recommendations so I can get on some good breeders waitlists for now!

2023-10-22,1697988897,Border Collie with potential health issues causing me stress/anxiety,"Shes 14 months old now.

Looking back I cannot be certain she had issues since the start or was just regular puppy behaviour but she never fully got out of wanting to wee, its just after the 8/9 month mark she whined or barked for out and if I ignored her she went anyway but that itself is better in that now she just whines and barks but doesn't go.

More and more over the past 4 months she wants out regularly, yes BC's are high energy breeds but it went from 2 hours on average but able to hold 3+ hours if she was napping to about 2 months ago sometimes wanting out as much as 3 times in a row even if she was already out for 15-30 minutes and did multiple wee's in this period what the most common thing I picked up was if she wee's once no matter if its straight away or after 5 minutes wait a few more minutes and she will go again and this lowers greatly the chances she wants straight back out or within 10-20 minutes.

A pet hospital and a local vet can't find issues but local vet is giving her x rays next week, the first time it happened 4/5 months ago antibiotics worked for about 10 days.

The only time she was actually able to hold it in for 3 or more hours in past 4 months is for the week after she was spayed she never once asked for out but I took her out anyway and she just did it, I assumed that much of her issues were diet related as shes on dry diet bar the odd day or two a week I gave her trays of wet food and when she was recovering from surgery I gave her boiled chicken, no rice or veg, the day she went back on dry food she started asking for out again, mostly around a hour on average but sometimes wanted out twice, but the past week and especially past about 4pm (she has dinner around 5pm-6pm) I can take her out, she can do 1,2 even 3 weeks in under 5 minutes take her in and the second I sit downs she barks and barks, I try and leave it as long as I can but I take her out again and she does a big wee, comes back in and then the cycle continues.

A few days back she had a huge wee and wanted out straight away I again tried leaving it as long as I could but at the 15/20 minute mark I took her out, a neighbours kid who likes her was there and she rolled over and this large stream of pee shot in the air so she wasn't pretending to just go outside.

Today I took her for a hour walk, she was fine and wanted to nap a hour later she asked for out but I was on phone she barked the whole call and afterwards I took her out she did a big wee then came back in and was restless and wanting a wee again, she backs off I am in bedroom, kitchen or bathroom though which is strange and I was cleaning and when I came back through she was barking for out again, took her out, came back in and she sat on her bed and barked at me.

Because of this I often only get actual free time when she naps for a long time which for her is normally around 8pm and she won't bark after that, so I am anxious/stressed all the time as I can't sit down and watch something as she barks meaning its breaking my concentration, and by time she finally settles at night I am exhausted and don't have the energy.

Oh and I forgot to mention, whilst she mostly wee's very quickly when we go outside sometimes it takes her a minute or two and she rarely wants to go in our garden so I have to walk her to a field and if its dark carry a torch with me, and means I can't just have a dressing gown on if its nighttime

Also a few other annoyances, I have a neighbours dog she has a crush on and he can bark at random, can go days without barking once and other times a few times each for 5-10 minutes right now she finally was having a nap but the second she hears him she whines, runs to window jumps up then barks until he stops and also means she wants out to see him and often barks till I let her out.

I can't handle this, I live alone so my heart feels its beating fast due to stress and I almost shake and I have started snapping at her loudly",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17dvzgx/border_collie_with_potential_health_issues/

2023-10-22,1697983206,Help with a nervous pug! Thank you!!!,"Sorry If my questions are dumb! 

So my Pug, Pugzie, got attacked for the ninth time by the same neighbors dog! two year of intense training, hard work, and socialization. She now seems like a nervous wreck!

I am here because I wanted to ask if she is reactive, nervous, or neither! I also wanted to ask if i should hire a professional trainer! I will describe her symptoms here:

First off when she sees a dog she will stare at them! sometimes she will bark, and sometimes she won't! its for sure she will stare at them, and has a hard time breaking that focus! I have been training her not to bark a dogs so maybe thats why she stopped, but she will slip some barks! Most of the time when she stares she will lift a paw! not sure if that means anything with her body language!

When we are walking and a dog barks at her, sometimes she will walk past fine, only if i guide her with a treat tho. Other times, she will start barking, and fixating on them, while she raises all her hackles! When this happens i have no choice but to step on the side. When she hears a dog bark she will most likely bark too!

When she hears a dog bark anywhere, she will go off! its the worst in the house. Her hackles will raise and she will be very stiff and alert. Normally she will make a bug alert bark, and then continue her bark storm! 

The worst of it I will explain here. The dog who bites Pugzie is our neighbors dog. Their dog also bites Pugzie through the fence (we do not let Pugzie there anymore), and has a HUGE fence fighting issue. Before all of this Pugzie was fine with dogs, and never had a reaction in the backyard. Now when i let Pugzie out, she will instantly charge around the backyard with her hackles raised, pacing back and forth barking at the neighbors side. If she hears the neighbors dogs collar jingle she will have a huge reaction, and it gets worse when she hears the dog bark!

But if the dog barks when Pugzie is outside this is when she gets her worst. She will SPRINT to the neighbors fence and start having a horrible fence fighting reaction! no stopping her. Treats, loud noise, removing her, nothing. She would be unable to settle after, and her body language would be very alert.

Out on a walk Pugzie doesn't step near the neighbors house! she is terrified of that area! 

Sorry for such a long read! if you made it here i really thank you for putting up with me! im really confused! Is she reactive? I would say she is but sometimes she doesn't bark, and can walk past dogs just fine! she will be staring, but no reaction!

Thank you so much guys!!! I appreciate you!!! ",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17dtx6s/help_with_a_nervous_pug_thank_you/
2023-10-22,1697982469,Dog suddenly very protective of new house,We recently bought a house (~2 months ago) and our dog 1.5M is struggling with the change. At our old apartment he would bark if there were excessive noises or other dogs barking but overall was able to relax after the incident. Lately he has been hyper aware of every movement or sound outside of the house and it feels like he is always on alert two seconds away from having a barking fit. I know this is still new and he is probably confused. We try background noise and every time he sees/hears something I try to acknowledge before he starts but it doesnt seem to have any affect. We do plan to get window coverings in the near future to block some sight reactions but I cant figure out how to make him comfortable in the house until then.

2023-10-22,1697969948,My dog is pleasing himself?,"Hello, sorry for this strange post, but I hope to find people with similar experiences as Im not sure what to do.

I have a 13 month old intact Australian Shepherd male. When he was 8 months old, he began to lift his leg while urinating and also started to suffer from foreskin infections. He also started behaving strangely about two to three times a day. He gets really worked up and somewhat violently nudges the area between his penis and testicles with his nose, shaking his hips. He also licks the area excessively during these times, which I thought had to do with the infection. I took him to the vet and treated the infection, but although that problem was solved, the behavior didnt stop. This made both me and the vet consider it to be sexual behavior, as my dog is going through puberty and medical issues were ruled out. We tried homeopathic remedies, but they had no effect. The only option we have left is to neuter him, but I dont think thats a good idea as he is quite insecure and taking away his testosterone might make that worse. He also does not hump anyone or anything and is (surprisingly) very well behaved around female dogs in heat. Im also not sure what triggers his behavior as it has occurred in many types of situations.

I think my dogs great, but Im concerned his behavior might cause issues in the future. My vet cant offer many answers as she has never encountered this kind of behavior before, neither can other dog people Ive asked. Does anyone have experience with similar behavior?

2023-10-22,1697963324,Obsessively marking on walks,"Hi! I have a 14months old 4.5kg male maltese-mini schnauzer mix that has always looooved sniffing on walks. I always gave him freedom to explore his surroundings, choose the road he wants to take and sniff his heart out, i figured his freedom is already limited to my apt, the leash and my neighbourhood, so let him do what he wants (as long as he is safe and doesnt bother others obv). Of course i sometimes have to stop him etc, we need some rules to keep moving, but that was my general philosophy. 

I will admit i also used to be very judgmental and always felt sort of sorry for dogs on those rly short leashes that were just heeling by their owner all the time. I learned a lot more since.

Now i feel like i messed it all up. My boy still loves to sniff, he is very curious and a stubborn little thing in general. And maybe i shouldnt have spoiled him so much and let him lead ur walks. Because since puberty hit, he became a little menace. He drags me to every little patch of grass and then sniffs and licks urine and marks it. Its incessant and became this obsessive thing where we cant walk normally anymore at all.

I know it might just be puberty, he received a neutering implant a couple of days ago and although im seeing no changes yet i knwo it can take a while to take full effect and am hoping it gets a bit better. 

But im still very worried it became a habit. I am also worried i made a mistake of letting him do it, maybe he is bored and i need to redirect him somehow or sth? He is also reactive, if that is relevant, and so on one hand i want him to sniff and find stuff to do that doesnt involve other dogs, but i also feel like the way he is erratically, anxiously running around and pulling and is unable to focus on me atm is hindering our ability to maneuver triggers properly. 

Is there anything i can do to snap him out of this? I tried with treats and redirection, leave it or lets go, sometimes it works but sometimes he gets so stuck on a patch of grass i have to drag him away. And he will still try again two steps later anyway.

 Should i just shorten the leash and walk him basically in a heel most of the time and only let him have one sniff session per walk in a designated place or sth? It helps a bit if i shorten the leash and tell him ew ew when he tries pulling to mark. But i feel guilty of limiting his freedom so much

2023-10-22,1697960540,Chasing Foxtails,"I was out walking my dog in our alley last night when he got a fox tail in his nose. I took him home immediately and looked with a flashlight and sure enough he had a foxtail barely hanging out. My husband tried to grab it with tweezers but our dog kept flinching and was unable to get it out. He was sneezing fiercely and by the time we got him to an emergency vet  his sneezing had subsided. They couldn't get him in and refereed us to another emergency clinic. We took him there and they also could not get to him and asked us to bring him back the next day. I always thought a fox tail was nothing to wait on and needed urgent care asap. So we brought him in today and they put him under anesthesia to get the fox tail out, but they said they could not find any foxtail in either nostril, however both were inflamed which can cause sneezing. they said it's possible that our dog inhaled the fox tail to the back of his throat, resulting in him swallowing it. They said the alternative is that the fox tail could have migrated further than their scope could allow for them to see. They advised if we see any thick nasal discharge to see an internist for further assessment.  The bill was a ridiculous $1540.00 and nothing to show for it. I feel we were ripped off and that the urgent care vet has no concern for my dog. Also the invoice they gave us says ""Foster had a foxtail removed from his nasal cavity. Sneezing and runny nose may be a result for short time following the removal of the foxtail. This is normal.
WTF!! On the phone I was told they couldn't find it.
On page 2 of the medical report says no foxtail was found in either nostril.
This was done at San Diego Veterinary Urgent Care on University Ave here in San Diego. Not only do I feel they did us wrong I have lost complete trust in anything we were told. I feel all I can do now is wait and see if my dog develops any problems if the foxtail is truly still in there somewhere. What kind of urgent care hospital doesn't have a scope long enough to look down a dogs nasal cavity?

We do have another dog, some sort of mutt who we love but is not the same. Shes a funny and quirky dog, but not much of a companion for me like our beagle was. We would very much like to explore getting a second dog in the summer and want to be intentional and thoughtful about the breed we select. We would love to hear what breeds you think might fit our needs!

What were looking for: -cuddly, companion -suitable for apartment living short term (looking to buy a house in the next 2 years) -not a short snout breed like pugs or bulldogs -a breed that is able to be around other dogs and children -prefer a dog that doesnt require significant and substantial specialized grooming -we live a moderately active lifestyle and take our current dog on many walks a day, as well as time in the dog park -we are willing to train a dog and put in the work if the breed needs mental stimulation as well -50 pounds or less for a female

Breeds weve discussed -another beagle -cavalier King Charles (internet says 4-6 weeks for haircuts?) -American cocker spaniel

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*No, we have had many other dogs

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

*We are looking for a puppy to help develop a strong bond due to the experience we had with the dog I've had the last ten years and then our latest rescue. We would be fine adopting this puppy or going through a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

*another beagle -cavalier King Charles (internet says 4-6 weeks for haircuts?) -American cocker spaniel

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*Basic commands- sit, stay, ""spot"" aka place, come, etc. We've successfully taught our dogs this in the past and have worked with positive reinforcement trainers when we have needed them. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

*Between both of us, 2-3 hours a day for training or playing, etc. Interacting, we envision the dog on our lap a lot and cuddles on the couch!

2023-10-21,1697924709,Question RE: Roughhousing,"Hi all - 

Some history - my family and I recently adopted a 5 y/o rescue. She's been great, but my older daughter has ADD and doesn't always attend to the dog's signals. Recently, the dog has been showing my interest in my older daughter (we've been coaching her pretty intensively on trying to read the dog). This dog is a herding dog, but hasn't ever nipped at our kids to ""herd"" them - she's only ever ""cobbed"" us and this is always occurred in situations where she's getting lots of attention and is being pet and she seems very happy.

Today, my daughter (age 6) was playing with the dog - they were having a good time. Several times, the dog rolled on to her back for her belly to be scratched by my daughter. The dog's tail was wagging and it seemed great. As my daughter was getting up from the floor (from playing with the dog), the dog went to playfully jump on my daughter and seemed to ""cobb"" my daughter's side, drawing blood. 

It truly seemed to be accidental - my dog's tail continued to wag and she seemed to want to continue playing with my daughter. I scolded her (the dog) and put her outside to settle down. Upon arriving home, my husband heard what happened and said he didn't think intention matters when it comes to ""bites"" and seemed to want to put the dog down. I disagree, but can also see this is a gray area. Any vets out there have any insight?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ddb9x/question_re_roughhousing/

He's always been anxious and high energy. On the advice of a behaviorist, he's been on fluoxatine and trazodone for about three years. 

Every day when I come home from work, he's on 10. He's just really excited to see me, and go to the park, but he doesn't know how to calm down. I can ply him with peanut butter, but he doesn't really calm down. 

Over the past few days we've been at my girlfriends families house. He seems fine for the most part, but he does not like her dad. He (my dog) goes at him and barks aggressively, almost as if he's going to bite. He's also become aggressive with both of the senior dogs that live here. He hasn't bitten one yet, but I feel like it's only a matter a time. 

On daily walks, he's mostly fine, but he displays the same aggressive behavior towards random people. There's no consistency to the aggressive behavior. I feel like it's more of an anxiety issue than anything.

2023-10-21,1697912988,what breed is our little pup?,"Hi, everyone! We just adopted our little girl and shes been listed as just about every breed.

As a backstory, she was rescued by a shelter from a puppy mill situation in Ohio (what we were told with not a ton of additional information), adopted out to a family, surrendered when she was just about a year old by her previous family, and had been back at the same shelter for the last 3-4 months when we got her.

She was most recently listed as a beagle/miniature poodle, but her previous vet records show lab and golden retriever, as well >7<û@

To me, she looks like a dachshund mix of some kind because of her size and shape. However, her ears definitely look like a beagle. I had a dachshund/chihuahua mix years ago, and she reminds me of him.

She also reminds me of my old flat-coat retriever in terms of her coat texture and length.

Of course, it doesnt matter to us, whatever she is, just thought itd be fun to see what some other people thought. 

If its of any help, when she was 14 weeks old her weight is listed at 6 pounds and when she was a just shy of 1 year it was listed at 14 pounds. Took her to the vet yesterday and she was 19.8 pounds. Shes about a year and a half so, from my understanding, shes full grown.

Personality wise, shes EXTREMELY mellow. Chews on her toys a little, can run pretty fast if shes excited and doesnt seem to have much interest one way or another in other dogs. 

Thoughts? Anyone have a similar looking pup?

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Nope, we have had a few dogs in the past, e.g. spaniel and golden retriever.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Don't mind either.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

On the smaller side, quite biddable so my dad can train it. Affectionate but not scared to be independent. Would have to be good with kids as we have a 10 year old  in the house. Would prefer a dog with less drive because we are also looking into getting a cat. No shedding and not much barking.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Mostly toy breeds like poodles, chis etc. I have a soft spot for terriers and hounds esp borzoi, italian greyhounds, westies but knowing we might also have a cat at some point, might not be a good idea.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Recall if possible, sit, stay, roll over, paw etc. Maybe some more difficult things in the future.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

 Not really.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

A few hours

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Would never take my dog to a dog park. Willing to do an hour or two of exercise depending on the day.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Don't mind at all, but don't want it to be high maintenance. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium/Small 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

As little shedding and barking as possible but absolutely no slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Never unleashed unless properly recall trained, doesn't include in the house and garden.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A little bit of both.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Again, a little bit of both. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

We don't get many visitors but as little barking as possible would be nice.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Possibly.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Not really.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

If alone, probably 2-3 hours but that's not everyday, there will mostly be someone at home so separation anxiety isn't a major problem.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Dad wants a larger biddable dog, mom wants a smaller non shedding affectionate dog (Unfortunately not possible), and for me the same as my mom. Everyone will take care of the dog.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

May look into getting a cat soon enough.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, a 10 year old, but they understand boundaries.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

None.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Immediately afterwards, it seemed very shell shocked but went back to normal after a day or two. However, it's behavior has changed substantially. It no longer comes to the  
door, and has very little response to any sort of stimuli. It spends nearly all of the day sleeping, hardly doing anything it used to. My parents, unaware of what I did, took it to the vet who concluded it was due to hearing loss and old age. However, I'm pretty sure I know the truth. It has PTSD from me abusing it. It's soul has been completely and entirely crushed. I'm just in total confusion and disbelief right now. Why did I ruin the golden years of the best pet our family's ever had?

2023-10-21,1697908582,How to introduce your dog to the pool,"Hey guys, a few months ago my family adopted a Border Collie which has now turned 8 months old.

She spends most of her time in the back yard, where we have a large swimming pool.
All this time, the pool wasnt an issue of interest for her. She didnt drink from it, didnt even attempt to get in.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing, as her lack of interest in the pool is one less thing to worry about it also leaves us worried whenever she's left alone in the house. Whenever that time comes, we either leave her inside or lock her in one of the sides of the house (outside). She doesnt like neither of this options and it breaks our heart to see her bored when we return, we know she'd be much better off just staying in the yard, but we are afraid she may accidentally fall in the pool.

Summer is coming to where I live, and it would be a great time to teach her. She's already seen a few people jump into the water, but she still doesnt approach. My pool is deep, with a very shallow end (I think its called a solarium) where she could reach if she was to fall or even jump and easily get out.

I need to teach her to get into the water and swim to that part but I dont want to just pick her up and get her inside.

2023-10-21,1697906027,"4 month old extremely attached to my mom, his behavior changes drastically","
Hey all, I have 4 month old maltese/poodle mix I love and adore, he's extremely smart, almost potty trained and crate training has been great as well, he plays, eats and sleeps well in his crate.

Problem is... every time my mom is over (usually every 7-8 days) he becomes a brat. Day time he follows her everywhere and if she goes out of sight for him he starts winning and crying because he wants to know where she is and be with her and at night time he doesn't sleep and whines for hours wanting to be with her as well, I took him out last night just to see what he'll do and what he wanted and he went straight to the room my mom was sleeping in and started scratching the door, it was so bad he was shivering in his crate because he wanted to be with her.

I feed him, play with him and trained him since I got him, my mom doesn't do any of that, why is he so attached to her if she isn't the main care giver? And how can I improve this behavior?

2023-10-21,1697905761,"My dog doesnt like other dogs, and has bad anxiety. What should I do?","For some background, I have a 4 year old chipoo (chihuaha poodle mix) named Kins and she has bad anxiety. If I leave the house, she will sit on the couch staring at the door and sometimes even cries/screams for a few hours. My family has to physically bring her into a room with them to get her away from staring at the door. We are getting ahold of her separation anxiety now with Trazadone, I give her a dose when I leave and Ill be gone for a while. It seems to kind of help more. 

She is very loving and good with our cat and 95% of the time is good with our shihtzu.
Her only issue with our 10 year old (F) shihtzu is possession over treats. My shihtzu likes to try and steal them from kins, who likes to hide them. Shes very possessive and this leads kins to attack, through rarely, it is bad. 
My dogs main issue is the dogs that dont live with us. For example, my gf has a german shepard mix named Bambi, we take them on walks together atleast once a week. When we do walk, my gf picks me and my dog up to go. When were walking, kins keeps her distance from bambi but theyre co existing well. Its not so much the walk thats the issue but the car ride. Bambi sits in the back seat and kins sits in my lap. When kins looks at bambi, kins will growl, shake really bad, start showing her teeth and move as if shes gonna attack. I obviously hold her so she cant act on it, but in between the growling, shell start wimpering and kind of hide. Bambi just ignores her (bambi is so sweet, doesnt show any agression). When kins is trying to act like bambi is not there, shes perfectly fine.
Ive also tried taking her to dog parks to get her accustomed (Vet and Gf told me its a good try) but she doesnt leave my side. She shakes the whole time and avoids any other dog. 
I know i shouldve got ahold on this when I first got Kins as a puppy but for one, it wasnt as bad as it is now, she was just scared of EVERYTHING, and second of all,  I was a dumb 16-17 year old who didnt know how to take care of a dog! 

I love my dog and shes everything to me. I dont ever want to let her go. My gf and I are moving in together in the next year and I want to get to a point where kins is good around bambi. I just have no idea where to begin.  Does anyone have any advice or have experienced something like this?

Nor did we realise the ethical concerns surrounding them. I absolutely adore my dog, and I'm so grateful that we got him. He's overall a great dog aside from wanting to eat everything - and his awful recall (which is probably our fault). I guess what I'm trying to understand is, is there really anything inherently bad about breeding labrador with a poodle? Especially if their parents were genetically tested, or came from linage with desirable traits? 

The biggest issue with designer dogs, is that they are not bred ethically. Parents aren't tested, the mothers and pups are often living in shitty living conditions, the ""breeders"" aren't ""breeders"", they're generally just doing it for a quick buck without adequate training, etc. Don't get me started on backyard breeders. If governments were to properly legistate conditions for which cross-breeders needed to meet before they bred dogs, would designer dogs become more acceptable?

2023-10-25,1698232102,Crate trained dog barking in crate at night,"Hi there! Im hoping to get some insight, as Im a new dog mama! 

TLDR; our sweet crate trained rescue is suddenly barking in crate at night after 6 weeks with us, with no issues before. Any suggestions on how to address this? 



My family rescued a 2-3 year old golden retriever about 6 weeks ago. Shes just an absolute sweetheart. 

We were informed by the rescue that she was not only crate trained, but that she loved her crate. This didnt matter to us one way or the other, but since her foster told us she loved a crate, we got her one and have been using one since we got her 6 weeks ago. She goes in without issue when we leave the house for a bit (1-3 hours max a few times a week), and at bedtime she goes in her crate without us even telling her to after her pre-bedtime potty time. 


Her crate is in the kitchen, where we leave the door open all day as long when were home. She goes in there willingly when were in the kitchen,  but not obsessively to the point where it seems like anxiety needing to be near us. She lies in her crate during our mealtimes most of the time (sometimes at our feet lying under the table), and will go in there when were doing dishes, sitting at the table working, etc. Sometimes she lies on her bed or on the couch in the living room while well in the kitchen too, so if doesnt seem like a separation anxiety thing. 

When Im actively cooking or when we have just sat down to eat, I sometimes redirect her into her crate to reinforce it so she doesnt get caught under my feet when cooking/to discourage begging.



This week, 1 night she didnt pee before bed - we opened the door and walked outside but she looked at us with tired eyes and went to her crate, as if to say I am too tired to potty


Early that morning, we heard her whining, whcuh after a couple minutes turned to barking,  so we thought maybe she needed to potty, so we let her out of her crate and she ran to the door and peed outside. After, she went back into her crate and we all went back to sleep. 


Now we wait outside with her till she pees first before bed, and we give her a few kibbles after. Several nights passed without incident so we thought it was a one off. 


This evening, she woke us up barking at 1am, and again at 3am. The first time she went to the living room and seemed like she wanted to play, but went pee outside when prompted. At 3am, she didnt need to potty, was just barking. 

My husband ended up sleeping on the couch at this point because

 1. We dont know if were supposed to let her bark it out 


2. We have a toddler who will wake up if she barks too long (has woken up from a nap when someone is at the door and our pup barks)


We assume letting her out and sleeping on the couch this evening was probably reinforcing the behavior,  but we want to know how to approach this so we dont cause her stress. 

Also, we would not mind her sleeping in our room, but we have a cat and theyre not acclimated to each other yet, and our room is his safe spot right now. 

We also dont NEED to crate her at night per se, but since shes new to us and cant sleep in our room yet, we prefer her in her crate when unsupervised at night. 

Also, we cover the crate with a sheet and have a fan on for white noise. And a comfy bed inside it too. And we measured her to verify its the right size.

Lastly, we have a trainer weve been working with and we plan to discuss it with her as well, but wanted to see various input.

2023-10-25,1698208327,[Breeds] Struggling to choose the right hypoallergenic dog. Experienced dog owners with allergies,"\*\*Hi! I'm new to reddit and this is my very first post. I am a 40F, married to a 35M and we have a 2.5 y.o. daughter. We have a dog we love and would like another. We live in a home on 1/4 acre and a very walkable neighborhood. My husband is allergic and so we need a hypoallergenic dog. My husband has been taking antihistamines for a decade for the love of this dog, and we need a path to not take the meds. He is seeking the immunology shots currently. In the meantime, we would love input about which breed to get that would be allergy friendly!\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* I had 3 dogs growing up. I was the primary caretaker for all. My husband and I adopted an akita/husky mix in 2014. He is 90 lbs and so calm and gentle. We were diligent about his training (Love that dog training program), and it paid off.   
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* We are open to both rescue or a breeder. However, we are willing to go to a breeder to get what we want. If a rescue, we need to verify the breed somehow for the allergy needs.   
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* friendly, while also providing some security. Good with other dogs or other animals. Sociable with people and children. Trainable, obedient, less than average amount of barking. hypoallergenic. Affectionate. Medium sized, less than 45 pounds. Not too small, larger than 15 pounds.   
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* We think we want a doodle, because we perceive them to fit the qualities listed above. Our experience with these doodle breeds is limited. We also considered a yorkie, a poodle, a schnauzer. My husband and I grew up with golden retrievers, labs, border collies, huskies. Not much in depth experience with other breeds. I  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* sit, stay, come, back up, leave it. Give a handshake, fetch and return. To be excellent at recall. a bonus if we can do some tricks but not necessary. Would love a dog who loves to hike.   
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* no  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* I think we can do a combined up to 3 hours per day currently.   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* average is 1 hour, but on the weekends 2+ hours with hiking  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I can reasonably brush 2x per week at a minimum. I already brush our current dog 2x a week. I am not confident about trimming hair, but would be willing to pay the groomer  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* &gt;15-40&lt;  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* low tolerance for shedding. low tolerance for barking (our current dog is relatively quiet). Indifferent about slobber,I  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* Our current dog has moderate recall skills (better when he was younger), we would prefer to have stronger recall so that we could do more off leash.   
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* We will not allow the dog on the furniture, but we are happy to do some cuddling on the floor. Our current dog is a love bug. I  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* I'm struggling with this question. My expereince is that dogs can be both of these ways from time to time and that is ok with me.I  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I want to be alerted when someone is at the door or in my yard. The dog should stop barking upon command. I would like the dog to be interested in the visitors, but cautious.  I  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* no  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* jumping  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* on weekdays, 1-4 hours. on weekends, 0-6 hours depending on special events that may come up.    
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* my husband is allergic, as noted. He will be involved in the training and excercise on a daily basis. I am the primary caretaker and in addition to training and exercise, I will be responsible for feeding, vet care, grooming etc. I  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* We have a 9 year old akita/husky mutt. he is 90 lbsI  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* yes. we have a 2.5 year old daughter and many cousins and friends with kids of all ages.   
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* no

Thank you in advance! :)

**\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\***   
  
\* Small breeds - we live in a small apartment!   
  
**\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\***   
  
\* Doggie will be our family member, that is how we see it. We will do our best to always include our pup in all of our activities. We like cuddles and lap-sitting pups hehe.  
  
**\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?**  
  
\* I owned a Bolognese, my husband owned two Chihuahuas in the past (one was a retired show doggie). We were both the primary caregivers. We are now mainly looking at some other breeds.  
  
**\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?**   
  
\* Nope, no other pets.  
  
**\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\***   
  
\* We don't have children yet, and don't get many visits at all (basically none lol), but we do plan on having a child in the next couple of years.  
  
**\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?**  
  
\* We own an apartment in a high-rise. Don't plan on moving anytime soon.   
  
**\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?**  
  
\* So far just me and my hubbie. In the future, possibly a kid.   
  
**\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\***  
  
\* Like twice a year haha. My mum occasionally comes over for a coffee, perhaps once a month.

  
**\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\***   
  
\* Not really, although in this area rescue puppies are quite difficult to come by (that is a good thing I think?) so we might have to go the breeder route.  
  
**\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\***   
  
\* We would like a puppy.  
  
**\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)**  
  
\* Small breeds only (up to 40 cm?)   
  
**\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\***   
  
\* All dogs bark and we are aware of it, however, we will definitely strive to train our pup not to bark excessively. Occasional bark when playing or excited etc. is okay of course, but prolonged one not that much.  
  
**\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\***  
  
\* I am happy to brush daily if needed :)   
  
**\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.**  
  
\* Little to no shedding would be the best as I am a bit prone to allergies.  
  
**\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\***   
  
\* Yes absolutely, happy to.  
  
**\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\***   
  
\* Slobber is not so much my thing heh.  
  
**\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\***   
  
\* As long as it's a happy pup and somewhat trainable for non-professionals, it's okay!  
  
**\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\***   
  
\* Basic commands are a must! We don't plan on any competitions etc, but definitely want to train our doggie to be well behaved and (at least usually hehe) obedient pup.  
  
**\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\***   
  
\* A lot of barking/howling - we do live in apartment with neighbours. However I know that this could be mainly diminished with some training.  
  
**\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\***   
  
\* It would be nice, but it is not super important to us as none of our previous doggies went off the leash mostly for their own safety.  
  
**\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\***   
  
\* Definitely walks at least 3 times a day, preferably one longer one daily. On weekends and days off, long walks.  
  
**\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\***   
  
\* Since I'll be around the apartment pretty much all the time, I am happy to dedicate most of my free time to the doggo.  
  
**\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\***   
  
\* Sleep anywhere it wants to, we will of course provide a doggie bed. When alone, we will leave the biggest room + hallway always open so there is space, comfort, but also not so many objects that could be a potential threat to a small breed, or objects that could be destroyed hehe.  
  
**\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\***   
  
\* Very rarely, although we'd like it to be able to handle some alone time fine. We both work from home, so are present nearly all the time. Occasionally, we go out to places not really suited for doggies, but aren't away for longer than 3.5 hours max (once a week, sometimes twice a week).  
  
**\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\***   
  
\* Yes, but not needed as we both work from home and my work is very flexible when it comes to occasional walks throughout the day.  
  
**\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).**  
  
\* Czechia  
  
**\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?\*\* Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.**  
  
\* Summer can get hot up to 33°C, Winters can get cold down to - 15°C.  
  
**\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\***  
  
\* 100! To us, doggie is a family member.   
  
**\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\***   
  
\* Yes!Aware of all these things.",dogs,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17g2nqr/can_you_recommend_a_doggie_breed_to_us/

2023-10-25,1698205420,Shiba Pooping Nightmare (vent),"TLDR If  you're thinking of getting a Shiba, know that Shibas don't like pooping in the same spot twice, or anywhere near their home base.  So good luck training them to go on command or in some specific area.  

My girl is nearing the end of her journey.  She's almost 15, deaf, and has severe arthritis.  She's always been the WORST example of a stubborn Shiba  pooper.  
It would take an hour or more per walk before she would finally find a place worthy of bearing her feces.  

Now that she's ancient, arthritic, and deaf, we can't take her out on walks anymore.  She barely makes it to the end of our short cul de sac before needing to lay down. ( Did I mention shes always been dog/leash reactive?)  

Her only option now is our backyard.  Where she's afraid to poop, for some reason I can't explain.  Maybe she smells the other dogs on the other side of the fences (typical subdivision.)  

She is let out 10+ times per day and will hold it until I refuse to let her back in each night.  I physically have to stand in front of the door and point her back to the grass.  She tries every possible method of slinking past a corner to get around me, and if she is let inside too soon, she will LITERALLY POOP IN FRONT OF ME once inside.  

This is all in addition to her bladder failing.  I have mild PTSD because I wake up every single morning on high alert for either pee or poop.  Often find both.  

I will officially never get another dog, for many reasons, but I will definitely never get another Shiba.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fvvmm/shiba_pooping_nightmare_vent/
2023-10-25,1698200886,Tips to stop dog barking,"The thing is, it's not really nuisance barking, at least how i think of it. She's a high energy dog, but i hesitate to call her nervous. She only really barks outside. We live in a fairly woodsy area that feels like an unincorporated neighborhood even though it's not.  
There's a fair number of dogs in the area that bark pretty often. Those a-holes taught her to bark. The real problem, i think, is that there are skunk and a decent number of coyote in the area. I'm not too worried about safety, as we have fencing and the 2 dogs are 50 and 80lbs. Nothing guarantees that a coyote won't get them, but i think they could find a better pair to mess with. Plus we're generally paying at least some attention when they're out.  

I call her the huntress, because she does a perimeter search of the yard every time she goes outside. She's very instinctive and fearless, even though she's the smaller dog. I think she's focused on protecting the yard, but I'm worried about being the problem in the neighborhood. She's been barking a lot more recently, and i just don't know what to do about it. They are both smart dogs, and reasonably receptive to commands, with no training outside of my wife and I.  
Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fufix/tips_to_stop_dog_barking/
2023-10-25,1698196806,Do you ever kick your human out of your bed in the middle of the night?,"My human sleeps on my bed in the bedroom of my house.

More recently, she's been staring at the big light box on the table and going to bed really late.  I'm actually a considerate doggo because I wait for my human to get on my bed first, and then at exactly 4 am in the morning, I will jump in the bed with her and sleep.

Since she's staying up later, I don't think she's using her bed anymore so I've been getting in it and sleeping there starting at around 9 pm.  Since I sleep horizontally on the bed rather than vertically, she's been moving me JUST so she can also fit in the bed-- the audacity.  

I'll be honest.... There really isn't room for the two of us.  I was so generous in sharing before.  So when she tries to move me around, I just burrow under her head and kick her off the pillow so that she doesn't have anywhere to sleep on my bed anymore.  But sadly, I don't think she's getting the message because she still tries to move me so she can keep sleeping on my bed.

Does anyone else kick their human out of the bed or room?  Does anyone have any ideas of how to tell your human that you're done sharing your bed with her and that she should go sleep on one of the smaller beds on the ground that she keeps buying?

2023-10-25,1698198044,Looking for a lower energy trainable dog,"Breed Questionnaire

 **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 

* I am open to any dog breeds that fit my criteria. Some breeds that Im particularly interested in are Great Danes since my family had one when I was a kid and pointers mainly the English ones since Ive heard German Shorthaired pointers are more hyper. I am very open to other breed suggestions though. 

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 

* I want a dog for companionship and obedience training. I want to train him so he can earn his Akc good Citizen and I also enjoy trick training as well. I want to take my dog lots of places like the beach and on vacations (I already know lots of dog friendly places from my last dog) so I want a dog who isnt too protective or anxious since they wouldnt do well with my lifestyle. 

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** 

* I owned a golden retriever as a teenager and currently live with another golden who I babysit for often. I have also owned a German shepherd who passed away a few years ago. I clicker trained both my dogs and my gsd earned his Akc good citizen. Both of my dogs were raised by me from puppyhood. 

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** 

* I live with a neutered male golden retriever and a neutered cat. 

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 

* I do not have children nor do I have any that visit me. 

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** 

* I own my house. 

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?

* I live with my sister but I will be responsible for my dog. My sister is completely on board with me getting a dog as long as it gets along with her golden. 

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**

* I have visitors about once a week. 

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 

* I will only go through a reputable breeder. 

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 

* I will be getting a puppy. 

**What size dog are you looking for?** 

* I like medium to giant sized dogs. I do not want a small breed since Im used to large dogs and prefer them. 

**How much barking is too much barking?** 

* My German shepherd was extremely vocal but I would prefer a quieter dog that barks mainly to alert. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**

* I am fine with regular brushing. 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?** 

* I live with a golden that sheds like crazy so thats not a problem at all. 

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

* I will trim my dogs nails and clean their ears weekly like I did with my other dogs. I also can brush or do deshedding if necessary to the dogs coat. However, I do not want a dog that needs to be trimmed/shaved regularly. Poodle type hair is a no for me. 

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 

* Neither bother me. 

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 

* I want a trainable dog. I can deal with mild stubbornness but being able to follow commands and respond to positive reinforcement is very important to me. I also prefer Velcro dogs over independent dogs. 

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 

* Skilled obedience and also trick training which will just be for fun. I will be entering him in training classes with a trainer I trust. 

**Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?** 

* Aggression of any kind especially same-sex dog aggression. 

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

* Its mildly important. I do not want a dog that is a runner or escape artist but I very rarely have my dog off leash and when I do its only when they have reliable recall and lots of practice heeling in controlled settings. 

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 

* I would prefer a low to medium energy dog. I do go hiking sometimes but on average I would prefer a dog that can be satisfied by going on daily walks and playing with me in my yard rather than going on long runs. My German shepherd was very high energy and I do not want a dog that energetic. 

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 

* I have a lot of time since I work from home. 

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 

* The dog will sleep in bed with me which is why I would prefer a cuddly dog. When I am gone, the dog will be crated until he can reliably be left alone to free roam. 

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 

* I work from home so not often. He will only be left alone when I run errands or go out with friends. If I am gone longer than 4 hours, I will have someone babysit him. 

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 

* Yes, to everything except doggy daycare since I do not trust doggy daycares because a friend of mines dog got attacked by another dog at one. 

**What is the general location in which you live?** Y

* I live in the US 

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** 

* I live somewhere thats sunny and cool to warm most of the time. It doesnt snow or get really cold here but it can get hot in the summer. 

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**

* 10

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 

* Yes, I am aware and prepared.",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fth9d/looking_for_a_lower_energy_trainable_dog/
2023-10-25,1698196791,My dogs behavior issues,"I have a 1 1/2 year old female Canaan. She is currently not spayed because the humane society has stopped doing them, although I plan to find somewhere that will do it for an affordable amount. Idk if that is the reason behind my dogs issues but thats what Ive been told. 

So as a pup, my dog had normal pup issues and I expected that. At 1 year we were making great progress. 3 walks a day, 30 mins - hour of fetch ect. About 2 months ago my dog began her cycle. Since then she has began tearing up things in the house whenever I or my daughter leave for any time period and it doesnt appear to be for food purposes. I have tried to putting calming tv sounds/dog tv but nothing works. 

My pup is fed dry dog food and fresh red meat 2-3 times a week. In the last few months, she refuses to eat her dry food and will bark/beg/jump and literally attack anyone eating any sort of food. 

My daughter goes to sleep around 8pm and my pup falls asleep in her bed with her. About 30 mins later, she appears at my office door which has a dog gate in the doorway. The dog is not allowed in my office because my work cannot have dog hair on it because I work in the clothing/textile industry. She will begin barking, whining, jumping and scratching the wall, knocking my garbage over and overall create terror until I let her in. It has caused me great stress and caused my work to suffer. 

On walks, she has began pulling extremely hard, she will randomly turn around and try to bite the handle on the leash which I am holding. If I try to shorten the leash she will walk backwards and flail her neck and body until I let go and give her more leash. 

At this time, the only time I enjoy this dog is when she is asleep. She is quite a good snuggler&other than the fact she wakes up in the middle of the night and barks at the bottom of my bed with her rope because she wants to play. 

Up until 2 months ago none of these things were happening. Can someone please give me some info? Is this all from starting her cycle? She has potential and I want to give this my best shot.

2023-10-25,1698194720,New Anxiety in Dog causing issues,"Dog age: 5, Pomeranian/papillon breed

My dog has developed what is either anxiety or fear around walking. Before she was happy to go on her two walks(morning and afternoon) but now she refuses. Shell either not come out to the backyard around those times/when I grab the leash or refuses all together when I say walk. If I manage to get her out she stops a few feet out of the back gate, tail between her legs and drags me back inside refusing go farther.

I thought the construction of a house not far might be a trigger(its strange noises) or the large dog in the house that is always in the backyard now three houses down(he has a very deep bark) I also thought my own anxiety might be an issue so Im making sure Im happy and perky when we walk.

I have tried going out through the front door and sometimes this works though shell either get startled by a noise and run back in or only go for a few minutes(she has always been an anxious dog and has set paths we walk on, so by going out our front door that set path is cut in half). 

I have tried treats and will get higher value ones tomorrow and try those instead. Do you guys have any tips? It has started to snow here so construction has halted so I was hoping that would help.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fscjl/new_anxiety_in_dog_causing_issues/

I still take him for walks but lots of the time hes confused and just stares into the distance.. these walks are not long. Maybe about 6 to 7 mins.. 

Really I do it for him to get some fresh air and walk around.. He wears a diaper all day and usually poops in the house.. We cant really get into a groove with him anymore.. Hell go right before a walk or even right after.. doesnt matter if I change the times..

I got him when he was already about 7yo the doc didnt know for sure.. he has some pretty bad dental hygiene and I got his teeth cleaned but it already turned into his bone disease where his bottom jaw is sort of soft tissue at the front of his mouth.. he doesnt cry or complain if I touch it.. hes really only awake to eat.. of which he loves.. but he literally eats everything or tries to.. like tissue paper, plastic straw.. his poop other dogs poop.. just put random things in his mouth like a baby and I have to watch him like a hawk..

He eats human grade turkey and chicken that I boil and feed him with premium dog mix.. its been good for him.. I think its why hes lived so long& Im just at a loss now.. idk if Im just prolonging his heartbeat or actually giving him a good quality of life.. he doesnt play with the other pets.. barely knows theyre there.. doesnt come when hes called .. he just knows sound ques like clapping hands or the bowls in the kitchen meaning food time.. 

Outside of all of this he screams in the middle of the night sometimes.. like screeches.. if I check on him he just wants his bed fluffed.. or more food.. but he doesnt really have personality anymore.. like hes just a shell walking around the house.. =""

I used to take him everywhere with me like my little travel buddy.. these days its because I dont trust someone else to take care of him how I know

2023-10-24,1698187101,Dog won't walk due to anxiety,"I recently took in a dog after his owner was hospitalised and couldn't take care of him anymore.  


About him:  
He's 4 years old, originally rescued from Romania and was neglected by his owner.  
Now he is anxious of men, other dogs and literally anything that moves, which leads to him being quite reactive.  
He is a neutered Corgi mix or Swedish Valhound,   
has a malformed and shortened front leg which he cannot use  
and is now healthy after being treated against worms and itching and today we good the bloodwork results back which are looking good.  


The problem with him is, as soon as there is any trigger (like the wrong scent of a dog, a car or bike driving past, wind blowing leaves, people standing somewhere, etc.) he will stop walking, lay down and show his belly (pretty sure it is appeasing behavior).  


At home he listens to me and comes when I call. As soon as we are out of the house he seems to have forgotten pretty much anything I trained with him.  
At times he is doing  great and we can take long walks without any problems, other times it is like we are back at zero.  
He has gotten better over time and I was able to actually go on walks with him, but the past few days he just did. not. walk....  


I try to get him to walk by calling ""here"" and pointing where he should go, as this is the thing that he listens to the best and giving him treats. But that also means that we walk three steps until he stops  and I have to call again (which only works a few times in a row till he doesn't want to anymore)...  
I am getting a bit frustrated with him and I am so sorry about it, cause I know it isn't his fault.  
But I am really dreading to go for walks now...  


 When walking with an additional person he walks a lot better.  


I don't really know what to do at this point, cause I feel what I am doing is not working.  


Did anyone have similar experiences or any tips for me?

2023-10-24,1698186547,Need some suggestions,"TDLR at the end; context ended up being a lot but I think its needed

Hey everyone! I need some advice or suggestions for leaving my 2 dogs at home while Im at work. Theyre both under 10 pounds and when we adopted them, they were on the older side. Im not sure if their previous owner was neglectful or what but my dogs did not come house trained (found that out later), and they are still that way. They were too old and used to peeing and pooping in the house I guess, and despite trying everything, they still pee in the house. Its gotten better over the 4 years weve had them, but we have to keep a constant eye on them or leave them on the couch. They dont really poop in the house unless they have no choice. One of the dogs got diabetes in may, and about a month ago went blind. His diabetes makes him have to pee a ton, and thus drink more water, making him have to pee more, and the cycle goes on. His blindness means hes unsure of where he is in the house, and sometimes hes not even sure about that, so hes been peeing inside a lot more. They go out to do their business every hour or so but I need a solution for a new problem thats come up.

When the dogs have to be left alone in the house, we used to put them in an old walk in shower that wasnt being used and didnt work, that was eventually going to be taken out anyway, so we put them in there to pee and poop while they were in there and the family was gone. This was easy because you could just pick up the poop and throw a bucket of water on the pee and then just bleach the whole thing, and the shower had a ledge that the dogs could jump up onto to sit on. The floor led to the drain so they never got pee on them and that situation worked out perfectly, because they also couldnt leave the shower and had plenty of room to themselves. Over the summer, my parents finally got around to taking that shower out to remodel part of the house, and since then, havent had anywhere to put the dogs besides the crate they sleep in, which they love but is just too cramped to have to sit in all day when they have to be left home alone. Theyve also been peeing and pooping in the crate because theres nowhere else to do so, and Ive been having to wash it every day for them. I feel absolutely terrible putting them in there for hours at a time but I have to go to work and I dont know what else to do with them. I was thinking I could make my own containment area with like a kiddie/dog pool and put one of those dog fences around it so they cant hop out. I havent been able to find a good plastic pool yet, and I dont know what I would do to keep them from just sitting in their own waste, but they would at least have space and not have to hold their pee forever until someone gets home to either let them out or until they just pee anyway. Does anyone have any solutions or advice for what I could do with them so theyre comfortable while theyre home alone and so I dont feel terrible about leaving them? Sorry this was so long, I felt context was needed.

TDLR: 2 elderly dogs arent house trained and my family used to have a place to put them while they had to be home alone that was comfortable and where they could pee and poop that wasnt random places in the house, now we have nowhere to put them but their bedtime crate which isnt huge and they pee and poop in it when they finally cant hold it any longer. (This sounds terrible but I promise they normally dont have to hold it unless theres no other choice).

I have a Bichon Poodle Mix named Russell, whos six years old and is the family dog!

When I moved out to a townhouse by my college, Russell hated being left alone there. It even got to the point that If my dad (his favorite) leaves, but we all stay, he will sit and whine softly until he returns. And when put in his kennel and left we will whine and howl until I come back.

He has never shown this behavior before and hes been to many different places and has been left alone as well.

At first I thought it was separation anxiety but now Im starting to think it could be something else? 

Ive tried so many different types of desensitization and training to the point that it feels like he just does this on purpose.

2023-10-24,1698176004,I hate my dog &amp; feel so guilty. Is there any hope?,"Hi everyone. I really need to vent. Any advice is much appreciated.

My dog is a year and a half old 20 pound shih tzu/terrier mix, my first dog (aside from german shepherds my parents had when I was really young), and I absolutely hate owning him.

I have tried every training trick in the book. I did a lot of research before owning a dog and was convinced that there were no bad dogs, just bad owners, so if I put in a ton of time and effort then I'd have a well behaved beloved pet! 

But almost two years in and I am at my breaking point. I kept thinking it would get better with steady training and that once he became an adult, he'd settle a bit. I would never rehome him or surrender him unless I found a literal angel of a human to take him, but I wish every day I had not gotten a dog. 

I socialized the shit out of him from the day I got him at 8 weeks old, but it doesn't matter. He HATES other dogs and strangers. To keep him from barking constantly, I am ALWAYS managing him and distracting him, giving him treats, trying every tip and method I have found. I work from home with a flexible job thankfully, but if I didn't then I don't even know how he'd manage at all. 

Walks are a nightmare. We do one 'training' walk per day and two more in quiet parts of town where we know he won't be triggered. We have a large yard for playing as well. 

Despite obedience training, he is the most stubborn and disobedient dog I've ever met. If he doesn't want to do something (or if he WANTS to do something) there's no stopping him. He's still chewing on furniture even though he knows he shouldn't and has so many chews and toys. 

He doesn't care about boundaries despite us constantly trying to enforce them. He is ROUGH - if he bites you and breaks skin when trying to 'play' and you cry in genuine pain, he just continues biting and growling in a frenzy. Trying to redirect him to a toy doesn't change that, he's only 20 pounds but will overpower me to the point I can't get away from him until my husband comes to help me. 

I just don't understand it. I did everything the books say to do, he gets a ton of exercise and mental stimulation per day, but I just feel on edge every second. I'm 8 months pregnant now and I just feel like I'm having a mental breakdown every day with him. My mom has taken him to babysit for weeks at a time in an attempt to train him as well (she has a lot of experience with german shepherds) and it was futile.

*  Std. Poodle; Doberman or Vizsla - I do enjoy a velcro dog. 
* I go camping a lot, so a dog that is people/dog neutral/friendly is probably best.
* I prefer a smarter dog. The difference in brainpower from a lab to a gsd was astounding to me. 
* Stubborn is okay (I know they often go hand in hand) just not Husky/Malamute/Greenland Dog stubborn.
* I am interested in the three title breeds mainly for the velcroness of the breed personality and because all three lean to the smarter side. Each breed has interesting characteristics and endearing qualities. Ultimately it will probably come down to train-ability and off-leash recall potential (aware each dog is different but some breeds are better than others with recall).
* I would love to hear from folks who have these breeds as part of their family.I am also moderately interested in certification for search and rescue (this is how I discovered Peps hip problems initially) but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\***

* Companion/friend/adventure buddy.  
* Possible search/rescue certification.

**\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\*** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?

\* I have raised/been raised by dogs my whole life. I am familiar with huskies, Yorkies, labs, gsds and Heinz-57 dogs.\* I have almost always been the primary caregiver of my dogs, even when I was a child.  I am married, my and my partner and my adult children would be part of the dog's life, but I would be the primary caregiver.\* I plan to do most of the training myself, certification training (canine good citizen/search and rescue, etc.) would be done with official trainers.\* Dogs have come into my life as puppies and as older dogs.  Every one of my dogs has passed of either old age or age-related disease/issues.  My Old English Lab passed from cancer.\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?\* I currently have three dogs and a cat.  This dog would not come into our lives until my heartdog passes.  There is no immediate timetable on that - probably within the next 2-4 years. two dogs are boxer/shepherd mixes aged three.  I have a six and a half year old GSD who has genetically terrible hips due to her mom coming from a byb situation - my GSD's mother was a pregnant rescue from an Amish area in PA.  The cat is 12 and may not be with us still when it's time to bring this new dog into our home.\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*\* No children in the home.  I have nephews and a niece that the dog would meet occasionally.  Part of my training would include introduction to children of various ages. It's part of the training I do with every dog I have.\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?\* We own our home with a fully fenced in back yard with an 8-food privacy fence.  We have NO plans to rent in the future. We DO have plans to move to wooded property with private hiking trails.\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?\* Myself, my partner and three adult children.  My partner is urging this research as my heartdog has mobility issues.  Every member of our family loves and interacts with our animals on a daily basis.\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*\* A few times a month - said visitors are \*rarely\* strangers, rather repeat friends and family who the dog will get to know over the course of it's puppy hood.\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*\* Most have been rescues. One was from a breeder. One from woman who showed her dogs professionally and only had litters for health reasons.

\* Normally I rescue. In this case I am thinking reputable breeder or another show situation.\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*\* I feel as though a puppy is my best venue based on the things I would like to train it for -- hiking/camping/off-leash recall/search and rescue.\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\]([http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg))\* Size does not matter to me one whit.  I know poodles come in four sizes - I would not be adverse to any of them.\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*\* 24/7 nonstop is too much.  Alert barking is fine.  Nervous ""what is that?"" barking is fine.  The dog will never be alone for more than four hour stretches (and that would happen maybe 1-3 times a year), so I am not too worried about anxiety barking.\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*\* Prefer not to do daily.

\* I dont care about coat maintenance but am concerned about thin coats/skin. Is this an issue for outdoors activities (hiking/kayaking)?\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.\* I am currently head to toe in GSD ""glitter"" so shedding is not an issue.\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home?

2023-10-24,1698165071,Hard decision to euthanize our dog due to age/medical and severe anxiety.,"I'm posting this here in case anyone else is in the same situation so they can get insight from my experience. Also, looking to hear from anyone who went through this same thing so I can get some relief from my grief. I'm sure there will be a majority of the posts calling me a monster or something to that effect.  
  
We made the difficult decision to have Rover euthanized due to moderate age issues and extreme separation anxiety.  
  
Trying to be as brief as possible with a story that spans 10 years. In short this is a very sweet dog who loved humans, disliked other dogs and needed to be with a human 24/7 or she would destroy and escape from wherever she was at.  
  
We dropped Rover off on Friday morning at a Pet Resort for a two night stay with a pickup on Sunday between 3-5pm. We put her in there so we could enjoy 48 hours of escape during our vacation to visit out grandchildren. Rover is 13.5 years old and has severe separation anxiety. Her anxiety has increased over the past five years to the point that my wife and I have been tag teaming with each other so someone is always with her. We have had success with this particular Pet Resort however we have only been leaving her there for day care and/or one night on the weekend. This was our first attempt at two nights in a row. During the day with humans around she is fine. At night they put the dogs in rooms in groups of two so they have a ""buddy"" and don't feel alone. Rover is only interested in human company.  
  
We got a call from the Pet Resort early Sunday morning. They told us that Saturday night she tore through two wooden doors (those cheap ones what are a frame with 1/4 inch panel on each side), opened several other doors, opened a sliding glass door that no other dog has ever opened and got herself caught up in a chain link fence. They found her inside Sunday morning with blood everywhere. The fence tore a 1"" hole in her hind leg that was pretty deep. They were going to take her to an emergency vet (only place open on a Sunday) and asked us to meet them there. When we got there Rover was laying on the floor on a blanket and would not get up. In addition to the leg wound she also had a huge hot spot on the side of her face where she had apparently been scratching non stop for hours. She looked like a prisoner of war. She looked like she had just given up and just wanted to sleep/rest/etc. The Resort owner felt really bad for the damage Rover had done to herself. We comforted her and told her it was not her fault. Rover loves it there... she just freaks out when humans leave and will kill herself trying to get back to a human.  
  
My wife and I have been watching Rover over the past several years as she entered the ""old dog"" phase. She is covered in fatty lumps (no issue), she sleeps ALL THE TIME, she has minor incontinance. She is on meds for arthritis and should probably be on pain pills and anxiety meds too. We tried anxiety meds a few months back and it was horrible. I know there are other meds out there we should try, but we don't believe in giving a dog multiple drugs a day just so they can not enjoy life but at least be breathing. What kind of life is it if you are loopy from drugs and you just lay around and sleep all day? We have had three dogs before Rover and we have had to put down dogs for old age in the past. Our normal situation is to wait TOO LONG because we can't make the decision at the right time. We've prolonged a dogs suffering before and told ourselves we would not do it again.  
  
So - our options this past Sunday were to either to make the hard decision to euthanize her OR we could get her x-rayed, put under for minor surgery/stitches on her leg, then pain killers and other medications for infections... a cone on her head until she healed. She had hot spots a few months back and we know she has to wear a cone until she is 100% healed or she will chew up every scab/sore until she is bleeding in less than 2 minutes. So, we knew that getting her stitched up and healed was going to be many weeks of wearing a cone and being under constant supervision. Then, after all that she is still an elder dog who probably has another 2-10 months of life left before she will have even more symptoms that warrent being euthanized. We feel that is a lot to put a dog through when (a) they have enjoyed 90% of their live and are close to the end (b) their quality of life is already low.  
  
I think most of my guilt comes from the fact that anyone looking at Rover would think she is five years younger and has lots of life left in her. It actually shows her extreme her anxiety is that she can go from a dog that does nothing but sleep all day to a beast capable of going through wooden doors and tearing plywood away just to escape. We have also put our life on hold for over 2 years just to make sure that she is safe and comfortable. Also, it's not fair to people like this Pet Resort owner to have a dog visit who literally destroys her facility.",dogs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fgxgi/hard_decision_to_euthanize_our_dog_due_to/

2023-10-24,1698153334,Advice on adopting a dog,"Hello!, 

I have never had a dog in my family before, only cats, lots and lots of cats lol. 

I really, really want to adopt a dog, and am feeling a bit lost. I hope someone here can give me some advice. 

Me and my long-term boyfriend bought a house together early in the year. We have no kids(yet), and both work. Because of this, I really think adopting an older dog would be best. Because they wouldn't need as much attention. And by that I just mean, they wouldn't be as hyper and need as much training and that sort of thing, I know an older dog also needs tons of attention, just in a different, more peaceful way that I think we'd be better at providing right now.

But, there are hardly ever any older small/medium sized dogs up for adoption in my area, only ever puppies and very large dogs which would be hard with the layout of our house, especially if they can't go up stairs and whatnot as the stairs to our bedroom are quite steep =+ 

I guess I'm just a bit lost because, maybe we could handle a puppy/young dog? My boyfriend works every day pretty early, and I work nights (usually) at a bar so I pretty much leave when my boyfriend is coming home, so there would usually be someone home most of the time! Except, when I do work the odd day shift I leave at like 9am and don't get back till 5 or 6, so that really wouldn't be okay for a young dog. I don't know. I just do not want to make a dogs life unfair who really deserves the best. 

Do you guys think I should just hold out and keep checking the shelters for an older smaller dog? Should I maybe call the shelters and let them know I'm looking for one? Just incase one comes in? Or should I just not adopt one all together and wait? 

That would be really sad to me, I feel like we have SO much love to give and would be such an incredible home for a dog that needs it. But if it was going to be unfair to the dog AT ALL I wouldn't do it either =+ I should add my boyfriend has always had dogs, and I have cared for many in my life, just never had one as part of my family unfortunately.

1) as soon as you realize your dog ate something poisonous call the ASPCA Poison Hotline. They make you pay ~$90 one time fee but its 100% worth it. We took our dog to the vet and they make you do this anyways because they work with the poison control experts to come up with a plan 
2) theyll want to know what type of poison they consumed, how much they consumed and your dogs weight. if you know exactly what ingredient is in the poison it can help them figure out what to do, so try to call pest control company who put out rodenticide or find the packaging if you bought it yourself. If you cant get in touch with the pest company (weekend etc) email them and explain the situation, they called us back first thing the next day (a Sunday) because they wanted to help and felt horrible 
3) if the ASPCA  poison control suggest you take your dog to the vet, do it immediately. This part is super important because literally every minute counts. They will likely use medicine to make your dog vomit so the sooner you get there the better.

Last night she then climbed in to bed to sleep overnight, which didn't go great - i mean it was great for her, but i tend to shift around a lot to get comfortable and the restriction on my movement made that awkward and at one point i got up to go to the bathroom and came back to find she'd draped herself straight across the middle of the bed.

(Waiting to spay until 2 years old due to research stating it's best to wait)

&amp;#x200B;

My 8 month golden retriever recently started her first heat cycle. She was bleeding a lot and not licking it all up so we put her in a cloth dog diaper (changing it and the pad inside it multiple times a day). However, the issue is she won't notify us that she has to potty anymore. She hasn't had an accident inside so I assume she's just holding it. We removed the diaper today after about 5 days of wearing it and she's still not notifying us that she needs to potty. Is this normal behavior? We have her out of the diaper now because the bleeding has subsided, or she's been better at licking up the blood. before it gets everywhere. Her vulva is still really engorged, so I know she's still in heat.

How much is too much for her to be licking her vulva? I don't wanna make her feel bad for doing what she needs to but I feel that she's CONSTANTLY licking it and it makes me worry about irritation or infection.

They have three dogs, two male springer spaniels who're around 3.5 years old, and a female collie/lab mix who's about 4.5 years old.   
  
Recently, our dog has become ***obsessed*** with the collie/lab mix and displays bully-like behaviour. She almost always puts her face right up in the other dog's face, she stands over her, nips her ears, blocks her from getting close to us, growls at her etc. and when my parents' dog has had enough, she bites back and a proper fight breaks out. If either of us claps or fusses over the other dog, she immediately comes very close to her and they both start growling.  
  
It's almost impossible to get her to stop, even if you physically block her, she'll do anything to get close to the other dog. It's honestly like she's possessed! She doesn't do this with the other dogs, and she's otherwise generally well behaved.  
  
Initially we tried to ignore it, thinking that maybe this was them working out some dominance-related issues that they'd resolve between themselves, but it seems to be getting more intense.

 7/8 am 
 12/13pm

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* This will be our first dog :)  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* We would preffer going though a reputable breeder  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* For us, it would a dog with a quite, gentle and warm personality, that can be aound many people, and is on the more social side. We would like it to be trainable, and respect the tranquility of our house and neighbourhood as a whole. My family and I have an active life style, so a dog that can go out with us regularly but also be lazy with us on our lazy day on the cough would be great! We would preffer a dog on the smaller size, and one that does not shed a whole lot (preferabbly not hairless).  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* We are interested in toy dog but any small/medium dogs that meet our criteria work for us :D  
\&gt; We have an open house but its not huge and our backyard is open but also not huge, we dont think we could accomdate fully to a bigger dogs needs.   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* Simple mannerism, training to follow instutions to sit, and come (to the person). And some other small tricks :). We would also like a dog that doesnt require a leash, but we will always have one on us, and is fine with a DOG HARNESS.   
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

2023-10-23,1698099167,"We have two dogs, need urgent help","Okay, one dog, a Lhasa Apso, recently had a stroke. She's still active but sleeping a lot theough the day because my oarents don't let her go downstairs next to the bigger dog and she's kind of just stuck in my room. She doesn't show any signs of depression but I have OCD and feel like a terrible owner due to struggling to take care of her such was walking and brushing, bathing , etc but I want to dk betterfor her. I want to know if there's something I can do such as making a routine for her? She isn't very playful, she's 10 yrs old and a rescue dog that used to be used for breeding, she gets cuddled, gets food and I try to fill up her water bowl but worry I'm going to poison her with the soap in it. I got oje of those auto water dispensers but the water just seems dirty. I tried getting her shaved the other day but she moves around too much and because of my OCD I'm worried about hurting her. I worry she's sleeping too much and I'm not doing a gokd job and I'm debating givinf her to someoen else but i don't think that's right as she's already been passed on a lot. She's not very keen to learn either (It took my 2 years to teach her PAW which i did with her everyday until she learned it)

We have another dog too which is either a Staffordshire bull terrier, an xl bully, or a pitbull. It's hard to tell. He's 2 years old has incredibly destructive behavior as he's overwhelmingly happy when just anyone comes through the door, he'll throw himself at them and run around like a lunatic for up to 20 mins. This dog isn't owned by me but someone else in the house. I've tried to train him but the owner won't lwt me because that ""doesn't work for her breed"" even when I've successfully trained him in the past. For some reason he's terrified of anything that moves such as brushes for some reason. We've had to use the brush before to stop him from attacking or lunging at people (we didn't hurt him woth it, we jsut gave the brush to someones to hold which I know is bad. Some of my siblings have chased himaround with the brush. I did this once or twiceint the past too i think but I would have been about 15 and have learned not to since then which i know was stupid of me and I'm sorry for those acrions, deeply. I'd never hurt him on purpose though.) He's freakishly strong too, it requires two people to walk him, each with one lead around a harness. I tried using a gentle leader but people kept telling me not to. We have a few neighbors that come over and I saw one slap him the other daywhich I was appaled by! He has a strange habit too that whenever's her wants tl see someowne, he places their arms into his mouth and gebtly bitws down but we don't know why. He manages to stop himself from doing this by getting a toy in his mouth or a blnaket.

What should I do? I can't take the guilt of having my own dog anymore and I feel like an awful person. I'm open to all suggestions!! I want to improve for both the dogs and help them anyway I can. We have been debating getting rid of the bigger dog to a more stable family, he isn't scared of us or anything, he's just too big and destructive to be kept in our house.

Thank you in advance.",dogs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ewpwb/we_have_two_dogs_need_urgent_help/

2023-10-23,1698104901,Dog breed?,"Hello all, Im not getting a dog anytime soon but I will be in about five years. And I want to make sure I can do plenty of research and be prepared before I get the dog Im currently 15 so Ill get them when Im about 19-21


**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog I own on my own, I currently have a family dog that everyone takes care of, however I was in charge of all training. 

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

I dont really mind but I will probably get a rescue. Unless this dog becomes a prospect for an assistant dog (I have a physical disability and some mental autism, depression, ADHD, anxiety ect ect) 

3. Describe your ideal dog.

Cuddly but also able to entertain themselves with toys, puzzles, ect. Easy to train, loyal


4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

My top three are Great Dane, GreyHound, and Chihuahua big difference I know, Ive loved greyhounds since I was 8 years old and almost adopted one, my family friend have two Great Danes and I cant get enough of them they are amazing and the perfect sizes and I just love chihuahuas they are tiny dogs with big personalities and I love them. I might just get all three.


5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience is a big one, as well as heel, recall, and if they become an assistance dog there will be tasks. 

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, unless assistance dog counts

**Care Commitments**

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Two 45-1 long walks or outside time, then probably 1 and a half hours of play, and then puzzles lick mats, and that sort of thing


8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

See above 

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Depending on the coat, daily brush, bath ever two weeks, and every two months or so depending on the coat a professional groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

10. What size dog are you looking for?

Large, or small I really dont care but I really like big dogs 

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber is fine, barking is okay but not 24/7 if its like started for a bit, and then they calm down its okay 

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important but I would like some sort of recall, as I will be doing lots of long line walking, sniff walks, ect 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Both, like I want them to be curly but I also want them to be able to entertain them self sometimes

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?


Both

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would like them to be friendly, but barking is okay, as long as they settle dog 


16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I would not outwardly go for a reactive dog but if something happens then I would stick with them and try and help them.


17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I dont think so 

**Lifestyle**

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

When I get the dog I would be in tafe or uni (im planing on doing both, TAFE than uni) studying to become a teacher, I would be doing part time two or three days a week for probably 4-6 hours. And then the rest of the week I would be working for 6 hours. But other than work I wouldnt be leaving the house regularly 

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?


I would probably have roommate but I would be the one looking after the dog

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?


21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

I live in an area with lots of kids, but I do not want kids of my own.


22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?


Yes I will be renting for at least 10 years, but my parents own rental properties one with a large yard, so I will probably be renting from them.

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Australia, Im not aware of the banned breeds, but I know these three breeds are not banned 

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer can be anywhere from 22 - 35 C

Winter can be anywhere from 10 - 25 C approximately but it does vary and is normally in the higher end",dogs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17eyuuf/dog_breed/
2023-10-24,1698107744,My dog my be a little too obsessed with other dogs,"So I have a 7 month old black Labrador and he is an absolute treat. He is learning to walk on the lead and has struggled to not tug or worse completely lunge. This is especially bad with other dogs. When he sees one in public its like he loses everything he knows. He will stand right up to try and get near them as much as possible, just constantly pull on the lead. Im quite concerned he hurts himself pulling so hard against the lead. I get him to sit, and he has come a long way to be fair, but he still cant help himself and you can tell he will rocket off as soon as he is given any excuse to move. I have recently tried heel-turning when he gets like this because I was told it would reset his brain and make him less excited or begin to associate acting this way with not getting nearer the other dog. But the only thing that works is waiting until they are gone. 

Ill be clear I always make a point to ask people if he can say hello. In the park off the lead with friendly dogs he just doesnt leave them alone. There is a grey hound shelter nearby and he will exhaust himself just chasing after them non-stop even while they completely ignore him. Hes just sniffing and sniffing them. 

All he wants to do is play. Its all he cares about.

My friend came round for the weekend and brought her similar-age golden retriever and it was a bit of a problem to be honest. My dog just wouldnt leave him alone even when given lots of social cues to back off. Hed just follow him around like a shadow. 

Can anyone explain this behaviour and maybe give some advice about how to socialise him a bit better? I feel like Im just indulging in what might develop into really problematic behaviour later on. At the same time its all he loves, he just needs to understand not all dogs want to play as much as him.",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ezull/my_dog_my_be_a_little_too_obsessed_with_other_dogs/

He has lived in my RV with me for the past several months and he NEVER has an accident in there. But while we were living in a house, he would pee on curtains, the corners of couches, table legs. Hes a mess.

Ive done crating, Ive done walks, Ive tethered him to my leg. If Im watching him or hes enclosed in a small space were fine. But if he gets one spot, one time, I feel like hell never stop wanting to pee there again (Ive done enzyme cleaners and everything).

Anyway, we just moved into a new house and Im looking at these gorgeous white curtains and I just know if I slip up ONE TIME Oscar is going to ruin them.

Im ordering the crate, I have him locked in a small room when Im not watching him. Im going to get waist bands (that he tries to tear off because hes a total dick, but whatever).

But Id love to hear from people who have struggled with this too. I know I need to get into a routine and put the work in.

For a few reasons, I like to walk my dog in the open desert lots between neighborhoods, mainly for the sense of solitude.

I suspect there is Coyote activity in these areas, and we have spotted them, maybe 5 times in 2.5 years.

Sometimes my pup alerts me first, via a change in body language, other times I notice them first.

The closest a Coyote ever came to us was about 25ish feet and it was an escort situation. I have no reason to suspect any wild dog activity in these areas.

My question is, when I start to take my dog onto these areas, he stalls, and sometimes even lays down, like, 'I'm not going any further'. This is totally not like him, and, so, I reroute us back to the neighborhood streets...

Could the smell of Coyotes be deterring my dog from wanting to walk here? Can a dog smell when, perhaps there is more than one nearby, as in the case of a den?

2023-10-26,1698353706,Taking in my sister's dog so he doesn't go to a shelter,"So my sister was trying to rehome her dog because she's moving. She was looking for months with no luck and i told her to let me take him before going to a shelter. We live in a liberal city with no kill shelters but they are always full and i cant risk him being put down or living in that stressful environment after living his whole life with my sister. 

Shes texted me that shes moving in less than 2 weeks and asked again if i would take him in. Right now my living situation is complicated. I live with my mom and shes currently trying to sell the house because its a risk for her to go up and down stairs (all bedrooms are on the 2nd story) They have been doing renovations for months now so ive been staying with my bf around 80% of the time.

When i told him i didnt know if i could take take care of her dog because A) ive never owned a dog ever even though i love them B) my mom never let me have one in her house (which i respect) C) im unemployed rn bc of mental health reasons but actively looking. He told me we can take her dog as he's fostered dogs before and his dog can do well with other dogs. I was so relieved and so was my sister.

Now i dont know what to do as a new dog owner. I think we may still try to find him a home bc my situation isn't stable and i want to be somewhere with enough room for both of us (me and the dog). Bf has a 1br apartment and i feel like i couldnt fully move in myself let alone with a dog but he said we'll make it work. But still i dont know the logistics of having a dog/rehoming.

So some of my questions are
-do i need to get his chip updated to my contact info?

-how do i handle him being in a new environment/ living with another dog?

-what are signs of stress to look out for and how can i comfort him?

-he wore a bark collar sometimes (im throwing it away) but what can i do to help him barking at any sound without it?

-he doesn't like people touching his legs so how do i groom/brush him without him freaking out? (He bit someone at the groomers once that i know of)

-how much does it cost to properly care for him? I know i need a job asap

-what are normal routines for a small dog with long hair? (Grooming, nails, baths, vet visits, vaccines) Should i just sync his schedule with my bf's dog? Do i transition from my sister's routine? (Ill ask her about all this too)

- hes a small dog but his harness is kinda snugg and kinda hard to put on with all his hair. Should i get a new one immediately?

-he doesnt really know how to play with other dogs or people but enjoys the company. He doesnt play fetch or tug of war. He plays with his toys and i try to play with him and get him excited which i think he likes but its different to how i play with my bf's dog. He does sit before a treat.

-do i get him a jacket for winter? Raincoat? I wanna spoil him but does he actually need it?

-how do i go about rehoming? Websites? How do i vet them? I really dont want something like this to happen again and want him to have a forever home.

I will be doing research but it kinda overwhelms me. I just want to feel prepared and give him the best home while hes with me even if its not forever. I'll also talk to my bf who has lots of experience but i dont want him to feel like I'm making it his problem. Im scared it wont be a good experience for the dog and i dont want him to be depressed bc hes not with my sister.

2023-10-26,1698347487,Resource Guarding: Positive Punishment and Positive Reinforcement,"My 11 month old puppy is usually very chill but he has resource gaurding tendencies. Usually he guards certain areas and he will agress upon our feet. 

Example: He gaurds the kitchen especially when cooking. Now, normally I would prevent this situation by crating him while I cook but sometimes he might still gaurd even when not cooking. He gaurds the area by snarling at our feet if we try to move. 

Our new trainer has us responding to the RG with Positive Punishment (Saying ""No"" in firm voice and aggressively shove him away using the shin) followed by Positive Reinforcement (Saying ""Good"" in happy voice followed by pets... assuming he stopped guarding).

Example: This morning I was working at my kitchen booth and he was underneath the booth chewing on the wood. RG was obviously imminent. I tried to lure him out but he wouldn't budge. It's dangerous for me to let him continue (staples in wood, etc.) so I lift up the booth and physically remove him and put him on a leash. I sit back down at the booth with him on the leash and he starts RG, snarling at my feet. I firmly said ""No"" and shoved him back with my shin (P+), not enough to hurt him but enough for him to go =3. He stopped RG and I immediately said ""Good"" in a nice voice and gave him pets (R+). I walked him into the living room and gave him love and attention and he calmed down and went back to normal. Since he started behaving well I took him back into the kitchen and hand fed him kibble (R+). I took off the leash and went back to the living room and he's been good for hours now. 

Now you might be thinking ""Why did you go back to the booth after you got him out? Why not go into the living room?"" (R-). And maybe you're right, maybe I should have done that. He would be removed from the stimulus but in my experience he would continue RG my feet in the living room. Besides I wanted to give the P+ a shot. 

I am curious what the community thinks of this approach. Personally my thoughts are that it makes sense. If he is actively snarling at our feet we can't do R-, what would we remove? The only option in my mind is P+ or do nothing. Maybe we could just sit there until he calms down then we can do R+ for the calm behavior? I think the P+ is balanced out by the immediate R+. We are encouraging good behavior while discouraging RG. Seems like it's being used effectively here.

2023-10-26,1698352814,What chews to give a picky dog?,"Junie, our almost 12 month old pup, needs some enrichment chews that she will actually like so that her owners can have a little peace and quiet :) She is a mix of a lot of things, and I dont know if its relevant, but she is mainly Lab (17%), Cattle dog (14%), Llewellyn Setter (13%), and everything else after is 10% or less according to Embark. Lots of energy and instincts! Please, if anyone has any suggestions, we need some ideas!! Im wary of giving her bones (we did try), antlers, or anything she could break a tooth on, but based on her chewing habits so far, I dont think she would bite hard enough to break teeth.
We have tried many types of chews (weve had her since she was ~3 mo.) and she has been hard to please. 
- Chews weve given and she wont touch: Himalayan chews, nylabone healthy edibles, yogurt sticks, soup bones, greenies, smart bones, beef tripe twists, collagen chews, west paw toys and other similarly built hard silicone/plastic toys.
- Chews that she liked but no longer wanted after the first, second or third: bully sticks, pigs ear, trachea tubes, beef tendon (she DESTROYED the trachea tubes and tendon when she got them the first time/few times. She acts like theyre gross now!), and we recently gave her a smoked bone which she tore off some of the dried stuff on the outside for a few minutes and then went to bury it in the couch. 
- Chews that she will chew/eat: Gullet sticks, no-hide chews (50/50), and chicken jerky, but these last only minutes if that. Sometimes she will go get the fish shaped benebone she picked out, she recently dug out the puppy dogwood and puppy wishbone that we bought when we first got her, every once in a while she will get out the root/wood chew, and she loved the ware dog gorilla wood chew from Hollywood Feed but we had to take it away because it was fraying a lot and I was nervous about it being too pointy.
- Non-chews that she loves to chew: She has torn apart (into small pieces) a Kong puppy goodie bone and puppy toothbrush shaped toy which were both made of a soft/squishy type of silicone(I think?), she will chew rope to break it, she chews small bits off of softer plastic toys (ears, horns, etc), and she LOVES destroying cardboard boxes.
When we give her new chews, she will usually sniff and lick it to decide if she wants it or not. If she hates it, she walks away from it. But, usually, if its interesting but she doesnt want to chew it, she will take it and bury it in the couch or blankets. Ill pull it back out and give it to her, and she will go and bury it in a different spot. 
Sometimes we will make lick mats and fill her kong and freeze them for her, but she is picky about what we use. She mainly likes wet dog food and cottage cheese, and will occasionally tolerate pumpkin, sweet potato, greek yogurt, and bone broth. She doesnt like peanut butter. As for fruits and veggies, she doesnt like anything weve given her except for green beans! 
I didnt want to give her a bone, but Im getting desperate. I was so excited when she was actually paying attention to it but was quickly disappointed when she went to bury it in the couch. She will sometimes chew on rope toys, soft/stuffed toys, and soft and bendable plastic toys. When she does chew these, she is chewing to rip or break them. I dont mind, we have a Barkbox subscription so she has more than enough toys and she has never actually fully ripped a toy apart. She just chews off any little bits that hang off like horns, tails, feet, and will rip out hard plastic eyes. We have puzzle toys too, but similar to the chews she does enjoy, they dont last long. And if we dont hold the board down she will just flip it to get the treats out lol! She likes the treat ball for her dry food sometimes but otherwise doesnt care much for it. 
So, what now? Is there an obvious chew that Im missing or is she just too picky and will have to stick with freezing things? Any and all suggestions are welcome!!!",dogs,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h635l/what_chews_to_give_a_picky_dog/

2023-10-26,1698349932,Anything I Can Do About Neighbor's Dangerous Dogs?,"Hi everyone, I want to start out by saying I cannot afford a lawyer, haha. I'm 18, live in a small house with my family of 5 people and 3 animals. 1 Dachshund, and 2 cats. I have an ""outside"" cat (I don't want her to be, but I have no choice), and I feed a bunch of stray cats who come and go.  
  
My neighbors, who have strong political disagreements with us and give me dirty looks, have dogs. My neighbors aren't bad people, their kids are friends with my younger sisters and the kids are nice.  
  
But their dogs are used to the country life, and now are cooped up in their house all the time. They are big dogs, not sure what breed. Sometimes, the dad of the house lets them out, or they accidentally get out.  
  
The dad has told our family that if his dogs saw my cat, they would absolutely chase her and kill her. Very distressing to hear lol. I asked his son if they'd consider getting a fence, he said no. I understand why, because of their parking arrangement and they are expensive.  
  
My 8 year old sister was taking my dachshund on a walk when the big dogs accidentally got out, and picked up my dog with their teeth. They held him like a purse lol. He's okay, my sister was TERRIFIED and crying. The dad felt bad but that was about it. Nothing was done about it.  
  
I... obviously don't want this to ever happen again, and I'm scared that it will happen. I have an even younger sister, and cats, and a dog; who knows how far those big dogs will go? I also feel bad for them, since they're big and need space, but aren't allowed to go outside much.  
  
I disagree with electric fences because they are mean, but I think that'd be the best situation for all of us. This is because they park in their backyard since there's not enough space on the street, so a physical fence wouldn't work.  
  
What should I look out for, and try to do, in preparation of this maybe happening again? Who should I contact? (NE Indiana BTW) Is there anything I can do?

2023-10-26,1698326106,Adoption fees,Why do some animal rescue groups charge more for designer breed or purebred dogs? I live in Atlanta and there are rescue groups charging a $500 fee for them. There was another rescue charging $175 for a kitten. I asked them where the kitten came from and they said they pulled it out of a high kill shelter. I checked the shelters website and the adoption fee for kittens are $25 with all vet work done and spay/neuter. So are these rescues paying $25 at the shelter and charging other people $175? I doubt the shelter would put down a bunch of kittens who are highly adoptable. The other day I went to check out my local shelter and seen there were some purebred dogs. The shelter isnt charging any fees for adoption at the moment because they are at full capacity. I wonder if these rescues will come to get them all and later charge $500 for an adoption fee. Ive been looking to adopt a pet and will definitely adopt straight from the shelter instead of these rescue groups.,dogs,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17gw9ru/adoption_fees/

2023-10-26,1698287183,Looking for Breed Recommendations for a family dog,"My wife (39F) and I (37M) are looking for recommendations on breeds to consider for our family. We also have 2 boys (4 and 2) that would love for us to add to the family. Were considering getting one in the next year. We live in a large home on 1/3 an acre as well as have a Lakehouse wed take them to during summers as well.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

As adults/family, this would be our first. When I was a child my parents were AKC registered Chihuahua breeders. My wife grew up with golden retrievers.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Ideally a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

One that is affectionate and playful but also does not require constant attention. Loves to go for walks or go out to the yard solo, happy to play with the humans but also ok with the occasional relaxing time on the couch.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

My wife and I were originally leaning towards a doodle mix because of the minimal allergies and have heard great things about them being great family dogs.

My cousin who is a trainer recommended we look into Lagottos for the same reasons but also because she has negative feelings about Goldendoodles.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Not looking to train for sport but mainly obedience and typical kid friendly things.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We can devote up to a couple of hours each day directly to the dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Happy to take them to a dog park or allow them free roam of the yard. Walks are also clearly an option. Dog daycare is also a fun idea.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Happy to do what I can but very open to paying a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium sized dog ideally. Wife is very against small dogs (like Chihuahuas).

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Handle, or prefer? Prefer minimal across all 3. But Id prioritize minimal shedding then barking then slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Pretty important but definitely happy to get an invisible fence installed too

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

More snuggly than not.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Closer to eager to please than not.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Mostly friendly unless a threat is directly identified.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes but not ideal.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

None come to mind

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not that often. My wife and I work from home most days.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I believe this has been identified in previous answers already but open to answering additional questions.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Definitely 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Chicago suburbs. No bans.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

75 in summer, 30 in winters

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We do have a larger home. Also very much so would want to take the dog for obedience training. My wife does have allergies so less than average shedding / allergens are definitely required.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-10-26,1698335015,1 Year old male Pomeranian suddenly peeing on things indoors,"My 1 year old intact male Pom has recently started scent marking (?) at home and any indoor place we visit.  **I'm hoping to hear advice on how to put an end to this.** He was previously potty trained and would signal to go potty outside, this doesn't happen at all now. However he continues to sleep through the night without wanting to go potty. 

He has visited the vets and been given a clean bill of health, which leads me to believe this is a behavioural issue. He has a daily routine and adequate play, walking and nap times. No other behavioural issues. He's playful, affectionate, social, and not territorial of anyone or anything.

He will pee up the side of his crate, his soft bed, the legs of sofas, most doors when open, curtains, a friends coat hanging and touching the floor once, slippers, all rug corners, and pretty much anything else he fancies. Even when directly in front of me. The only safe place for him is on my bed or on the sofas. 

I always scrub clean with water clean further with an enzymatic cleaner, he always pees on it again. 

So far I've tried with no success: restricting access to areas, using pee mats, taking him outside more often (will come inside and instantly pee up something), a play pen (he'll pee anywhere in it), fake grass mats, clapping loudly or moving him as he lifts his leg to pee.

2023-10-26,1698331517,Hand-feeding dog,"Hello all,

**Problem**: We hand fed our dog following an operation, now she won't eat from the bowl any more.

**Context**: Our care dog from Ukraine ran into some health issues lately. She's 7 years old now and up to this point had not been neutered. When her period began, there was nothing out of the ordinary, but it continued for a lot longer than usual and the amount of blood that we found on the floor exceeded the usual amount on a day when we also noticed that she was sensitive to the touch. My girlfriend was hugging her and the dog started screaming like a pig on the skewer. Soon thereafter, whilst we were trying to find a vet that was still open in the evening, she began standing upright and couldn't settle down any more. When we finally found a doctor, we brought her to a car - which became a bit of an operation as we couldn't lift her up due to her pain. We used a bedsheet to raise her slowly and steadily.

Either way, it turned out that she had a Pyometra (a serious and potentially life-threatening infection of the uterus that causes it to fill with bacteria and pus). The vet gave her an infusion and antibiotics and told us to wait for her to stabilise again and eventually remove the uterus in an operation.

This turned out to be a mistake, as she bounced back to better health for 12 days, and then her health deteriorated again. We took her to another clinic, where they informed us that the other vet should have intervened straight away, instead of 'waiting it out'. They operated on her and successfully removed the uterus and then discharged her the next evening.

At this point, she hadn't really eaten for 34 days and at the clinic this was one of the main reasons they sent her back to us, as she's very primed to a select few people and refused to eat there too. They gave us Mirtazepin (increases appetite + anti-depressant) for the dog.

And yet, she didn't really start eating by herself again. Since she had lost quite a few kilograms (I believe it was 19  16) we started giving her treats - most of which she turned down, but some she ate. We thought that something is better than nothing. Then we started feeding her high calory dog feed (from the clinic) at her place and out of our hands, as she wouldn't get up to eat.

She was discharged from the clinic on Saturday, and now it's Thursday, but she still refuses to eat from the bowl. This is not ideal, obviously. We already started phasing out much of the medication (Kesium, Mirtazepin, Novalgin, Dia Tab) as per the treatment plan.

Do you have tips on how to 'reset' this behaviour? Novalgin (painkiller) can supposedly lead to loss of appetite, but we've been gradually reducing her dosage for a few days already, and today we didn't give her any so that there already should've been a change in behaviour if it was connected to this.

Perhaps this is just normal following an operation, but we are worried, as she has lost a lot of weight and didn't really take in much other than what we managed to feed her.

We'll be at the vet again tonight and enquire about this - perhaps someone was in a similar situation though? ;)

2023-10-26,1698328105,My 8month old puppy whines constantly all the time.,"Hi everyone, my eight month old male puppy whines consistently from the time he gets up to the time he goes to bed. He whines and walks around the house like hes bored. He has a ton of toys. He is disinterested most of the time though. He plays for a little bit but not long. I play with him and he likes the attention but not the toy so much.

Hes pretty happy outside. Its his happy place, the one place he doesnt whine. I try to get him to come inside and he rarely listens. He comes inside occasionally on his own but mostly I need to make him with treats 

A little back story, we got two puppies from the same litter when they were eight weeks, they are pitbull/german shepherd mixes. Our other puppy whos a female is the alpha of the two for sure. But they get along perfectly. Our male dog seems to be constantly anxious and never content unless hes sleeping or outside really. Hes always been vocal but the last 3 months have gotten worse. 

Weve taken him to the vet just to be sure hes healthy and he always is, he actually handles being at the vet better than his sister who gets more anxiety at vet visits. 

He does, and always has had anal gland issues. Weve had to get them manually expressed 3 times so far because they dont empty themselves for some reason. 

Im wondering if he is always uncomfortable because his anal glands are always full or maybe he has severe anxiety because of littermates syndrome? Or maybe he feels trapped inside the house even though its big and spacious. 

Our female is now spayed for the last 2 months but he is not yet nurtured. Could it be a testosterone, growth, issue?

Some facts about me and my husband and our lifestyle. My husband works from home and I am a stay at home dog mom. We take them to doggy day care every couple weeks and theyre great, love it. They go on two walks a day one in the morning one in the afternoon after dinner we have a huge fenced in backyard where they run around for 45 min at a time 4 times a day. And we constantly give them love support, we play, I try my best train them. (sit, stay, come, lay down, no bark, etc).

No abuse, We dont yell at them. We try to take them out and socialize them at pet stores, parks, outdoor restaurants when we can.. They do well at doggy daycare. All the workers love them . I give him massages to help him relax which he loves but it only helps for a short time.

Does anyone have any advice on getting him to stop walking around and whining all the time. Its making me think hes in pain. Hes always anxious and it takes coercing him to get him to lay down and relax. Im just not sure what to do. Thanks.

2023-10-26,1698327377,I lost my beautiful dog suddenly.,"I know many of you have been through the same grief. I've been reading a lot about it to see if it helps a little bit, but I can't calm down yet. It came out of nowhere, even though she was 14 years old. Maybe if I write it down, I will be relieved and I can help others what to pay attention to.  
  
My dog had a sudden belly pain two weeks ago, right before her dinner. I couldn't touch her without whining, she was just panting painfully and staring the floor. We immediately thought of panreatitis, she was already cured of it once many years ago, so we rushed to the emergency clinic, since it was already night. After the ultrasound they told us she had blood in her belly, and this is caused by a rutpured tumor usually. They said there was a chance that the tumor was on her spleen, so in order to save her life an emergency surgery was required. They mentioned that she had lost a lot of blood already, and if the tumor was elsewhere, they probably couldn't save her, so they mentioned the choice that they could put her down immediately. We were in totally shock - tumor? We were at the vet 3! days before this, she had blood test few months ago, and ultrasound often, and everything was fine. She was given plenty of vitamins and the best quality food because of her strict diet since her pancreatitis. She always had problems with her liver, pancreas and spleen, and she was coughing because her heart was already weaker, but all of these were under control, we thought. With these hopes and thoughts we immediately decided on surgery. We said goodbye to her and she was taken away, in fear and pain.  
  
Unfortunately it turned out soon that the mass was on her liver. There was also a lot of clotted blood in her abdomen, she might have been bleeding for hours, days. They said and wrote later that her liver structure 'collapsed', and it had several hemorrhages on its surface. It was also enlarged along with her spleen. They said there was nothing they could do to save her. She fell asleep forever.  
  
I haven't recovered since then. They said it was cancer and was totally inoperable, but it's like I can't hear it, can't believe it, I just read and read what could it be. I have found 'hemangiosarcoma', but she was a little white angel, not a typical cancer of this breed. I feel like I'm going crazy with the uncertainty, even though it doesn't help her anymore. I feel guilty that I couldn't save her but that's not what I promised. What if it wasn't cancerous at all? I know the diagnosis seems bad but what if... I am blaming myself what I could have done differently. I can see her scared look in front of me as if she didn't want to die. She looked massive and strong until the last minutes. I am asking myself, maybe they could have save her? I am consumed by the pain and past, meanwhile I'm also afraid of the future without her. At least I would have known in advance that there was a problem, and I could have save her from dying in shock and unbearable pain.  
  
Maybe one day I'll accept that it was the best choice for her in that situation, but now it just hurts so bad and missing her so much that I can't bear it.

2023-10-26,1698309166,Help with in laws dogs behaviour,"Background:
My in laws bought a puppy at the beginning of the first Covid lockdown. As a result of this, he was not at all socialised and now has many behavioural issues which havent really been addressed. He is aggressive when visitors (us) arrive at the house and has nipped me before when I was walking down their garden path (I was ignoring and not interacting with him when he was barking and snarling at us, we had just arrived). He is an entire male, if this makes a difference. 

My query:
This may be TMI, but last time we were at their house it was my time of the month. The dog would not leave me alone and was always in my personal space, clambering on the furniture next to me. His nose would always be in my crotch, he was wrapping his front legs around me very firmly, humping and biting/holding on to my dress. This behaviour is obviously not great, but my in laws do nothing to stop him. 

Whats the best way for me to stop this behaviour when we next visit? I admit that i am afraid of him, and am worried that he will react violently to my attempts to stop him as he has shown aggression before. I am not experienced with dogs, but would really like to have more confidence when I next visit their house.

We took her on a hike 6 days ago and she loved it as usual. She walked the entire hike off-leash no problem.

  
For the last 3 days she has been very reluctant to continue her walks. She keeps on stopping every 20 meters and doesn't want to continue. She tries to pull me back home.

This escalated on one of her evening walks. I took her to the same spot where she gets to run around off-leash for a bit twice a day. The second I unleashed her she bolted. She ran out of the compound, crossed a road where she almost got hit by a taxi, ran across multiple busy roads and I lost track of her cause she was so fast. I assume she went home and she did. She ran 1.5 KM / 1 Mile home through Asian capital city traffic.

Since then her odd behaviour on walks has continued. I even tried changing the route but she still wanted to go home after walking for 10 minutes and doing her business. She seems to also constantly look behind her and sniff a lot in the air.

I've checked her paws and they're fine. I put pressure around her body and she doesn't seem to have any pain.

She caught kennel cough 2 weeks ago and has since recovered. She is almost done with her antibiotics (not sure if this could have something to do with it?). So she has been to the vet recently for a check-up and everything was okay (besides the cough)

She's normally big on walking and exercising and loves to play so this just feels very odd.

I'm absolutely thrilled to share that I've just adpoted/rescued an adorable 8-week-old pitbull mix puppy. From meeting her the first time, she is really friendly and seems like a confident pup. She hails from a litter of 7 siblings and has already shown a lot of spirit and energy.  
Tomorrow is the big day she'll be joining our household, but here's the twist: she'll be coming home right after being spayed. Naturally, she'll have a cone on. I've done some reading and decided to buy an inflatable e-collar as an alternative, hoping it might be a bit more comfortable for both her and myself.  
While we've stocked up on medication, her specific food, and most of the puppy essentials, I'm a bit anxious about her first few days with us, especially post-surgery. I want her initial experience in our home to be as smooth and comfortable as possible. On top of that, I'm eager to start some basic training, but I'm not sure how to approach it given her procedure.  
Could you lovely folks offer some guidance on:  
1. Making her first experience in our home a positive one.  
2. The best ways to help her recover and adjust post-surgery.  
3. When and how to initiate training while ensuring she's comfortable and not stressed.

4. Any more advice for what I should do in the beginning with a puppy that knows NOTHING :). I want to raise a friendly, happy, and confident dog.

I have a small dog, Harley, who I always travel with when I fly back to my hometown and she's truly the best little traveler, so it wasn't a big deal to bring her with me when I flew back.

But the complicated part was that, I could only get in late the night before the funeral, and we had a 3-hour drive to my grandma's town the next day. With the services starting at 10am, I basically got as much sleep as I could before I drove down with my family to the church where the services were being held - and, just because the nature of the situation, I had to bring Harley along... to the actual funeral. Everyone at the church said it was perfectly fine and that it'd be no problem, but I still felt a little silly with my little Papillon/Chihuahua mix in my arms in the front pews of the church, with my grandma's open casket in front of me.

I was glad she was there, though, when my 5-year-old niece came up and started petting Harley; she's met her before at Christmases in the past and is absolutely obsessed with her. My mom was telling me how my niece was so scared to go into the church to see my grandma, and even when they got her into the church, she refused to go up to the casket to say goodbye. This poor girl was just processing the idea of death and saying goodbye to her beloved GiGi (what she calls my grandma, short for ""great-grandma"").

At a certain point, though, she asked if ""Harley knew GiGi."" I said she did, that she had stayed at GiGi's house with me a few times and loved her. 

""Well,"" my niece, added, ""maybe Harley would want to say goodbye to her?""

The three of us - my niece, me, and Harley - went up to the casket together and sure, it was a little awkward to hold my dog above my grandma's casket so she could say goodbye. But it was also the only way to get my niece to be okay about the situation; she put her little hand on the casket before asking if Harley had enough time to say goodbye.

In retrospect, I'm incredibly grateful for it, and my niece's parents were too. I wouldn't always recommend bringing your dog to your grandma's funeral, but I'm glad Harley was there, and I'm so proud of how she did in the situation.

2023-10-25,1698265805,Fair price for a dog walker?,"Hey guys! I have two dogs, Ralphie and Sophia. Ralphie joined our pack in March, after my Australian shepherd Bailey passed away. Hes a two year old golden retriever mix, that never tires out - no matter how much he runs, plays, sniffs, etc. Sophia is a 5 year old chihuahua mix with major behavioral issues. Some of these issues come from her being separated too young from her litter (she was 3 weeks old when we rescued her), but most of them are because when I got her, I was in a deep depression, and never properly socialized her. 

When Bailey passed, she was inconsolable until I got Ralphie. She doesnt do well on walks (starts going ballistic the second she sees a child or someone doing lawn care). This has gotten worse since I got Ralphie. However, I noticed that Ralphie tends to kind of bully her because he is so big? She doesnt get the same kind of 1 on 1 time that she used to get, as Ralphie keeps me running 24/7. 

Today I was on Nextdoor, and saw a 14 year old girl make a post asking for jobs babysitting or dog walking, and I thought this could be a possible opportunity for me. I reached out, and she told me that she is on the track team at school, and runs every evening at the park across from my house. She provided references, and asked for an opportunity to meet Ralphie before the first walk. 

I got her moms phone number, and have talked about it extensively with her today. She said shes grateful that I was even willing to consider her daughter, because shes trying to teach her the value of hard work. 

I thought this could potentially give Ralphie some extra exercise throughout the week, and may help with some of the extra energy, as he wants to run, not walk, and Im not physically able to run the way he needs. I also thought this could give me a few extra minutes with Sophia every week to double down on her training and try to resolve some of her behavioral issues. 

What would be a fair price for a 30 minute walk/run? The girl said she wants $5/hour, but I feel like that isnt enough to be fair. Would $20 per walk be fair for her? I know how it is to be a teenager trying to to earn some extra money, but at the same time, I am not the most financially well off person.

His name is Mason and he is a very sweet and nervous boy which we knew when we decided to adopt him. We know about the 3-3-3 rule when it comes to adopting shelter dogs and were prepared for a long road and a lot of work in getting him comfortable and trusting us. In the past 5 days he has warmed up to me a lot. He follows me everywhere and lets me give him plenty of scratches and pets. I can also get him to play with toys and get his tail wagging. He's even given me a few kisses. However, he is terrified of my boyfriend. Mason will not go near him, will not take treats from him, and hides behind my legs whenever my bf is up walking around the house. We don't know how to go about getting him more comfortable with him. Mason is not very treat motivated and doesn't get excited for them. Since my bf works from home he is around Mason 24/7 and it seems that we could be stressing Mason out more by being around him so much. We know we should not force interaction between the two and let Mason come to him but its hard when they are together 24/7. I have been walking him in the morning and at night but my bf does have to walk him during the day while I'm at work. Even in the past couple days, things seem to have gotten worse. The second day we brought him home he jumped up on the couch with a little coaxing and curled up between the two of us. Now we wont get on the couch with us at all and will freak out and run and hide when my bf gets up from the couch. We have tried to give Mason treats whenever he approaches my bf but he so rarely does and he is barely interested in treats at the best of times. How can we get him more comfortable with my bf when we don't have the luxury of giving him space and not forcing interaction? 

This has been really hard on my bf as dogs normally love him. He is having a very hard time with trying to give him space because he just wants to cuddle and love on him so bad.

I have also tried to do some basic training with Mason that has not been very successful. He does come to his name but I have been unable to train sit or stay. He will often not take the treat or will hide behind me. Should I stop attempting to train him until he has had more time to get comfortable with my bf and me?

Should we attempt to socialize him with other people and dogs? Mason is gentle and playful with other dogs and we can tell he really wants to play with other dogs when we pass them on walks.

Any advice would be really appreciated. We knew adopting a rescue dog would be hard but we didn't expect a dog that's so fearful of one of his owners and not treat motivated on top of that. ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ge95z/needs_tips_for_recently_adopted_nervous_rescue/

She's done. She's scared, yelping, tail tucked between her legs and will run back to our building door.   


how do I train her to be not afraid of random loud noises and things? I socialized her as a puppy (she's 9 months old, not spayed, maybe going into her first heat I dunno, no blood yet, golden retriever so they said to let her have one heat) 

she's good with new dogs and people ---  and environments as long as they are quiet or have a standard level of noise like a road.

The real issue is breakfast- he is extremely food driven and tends to be anxious. He will pace around, whine, and eventually start barking. Our house is really too small to 'ignore' the barking and he doesn't have a crate. We tried that and he just barked in the crate. He won't stop barking- will keep it up for 30 to 40 minutes until I get up and feed him. As soon as he's fed, he's back asleep for 3 hours.

I asked about picking up and looking at the dog, they wanted $200 as a deposit to hold the dog.Then come,pay for the dog, and pick up this weekend, they mentioned $200 is refundable if I back out.I told them I'm not really comfortable just sending $200 via Zelle, don't have $200 to risk.

I wanted to do this through paypal or something with some protection.They said they have plenty of rep, so not to worry.Since he moderates what gets posted, just not sure if it's a scam.Reviews seems legit, but most profiles are private, so can't check if they're actually real.

I offered them $25 to hold, but they want the full deposit.In my mind, even a low deposit should be enough.Also paranoid, as I've heard of people paying a deposit, getting updates,driving over somewhere, and then being ghosted

The other dog lives at the park (stray) and immediately started barking when he saw my dog. He eventually came over, albeit slowly and cautiously, and I allowed him to greet my dog. They sniffed each other and did the whole sniff behind thing - and it all felt relatively calm. The other dog then began walking away as I'd hoped.

However, out of nowehre, he turned around and immediately lunged at my dog who was now sniffing something on the ground and totally unaware. Fortunately, the stray dog didn't bite my dog (although it certaintlyl ooked like he was going to), but instead kind of pushed into the side of my dog with his mouth closed or at least mostly closed.

My dog didn't yelp or make any kind of noise which I would expect if she was bitten or hurt. She seemed confused more than anything. After that, the stray just walked off and I kept vigilant.

2023-10-25,1698258653,Advice Please: current dog to meet new puppy,"My husband and I will hopefully be adopting a new puppy soon. I am just a little worried about the meet and greet with our current dog, but not for the reasons you might think. Our current dog, Gertie (5yo, german shep/husky mix, 50lbs), is incredibly friendly and social, probably a bit too much. She gets very excited when meeting new people or creatures, often to the point where they (especially creatures) get overwhelmed by her. It is worth mentioning, almost every dog she has interacted with in her life is older than her, so maybe it has just been a factor of not matching her energy. However, she has never been great at picking up signals, even when those signals are full on growls and snaps. The only time she has spent with a puppy was shortly after we adopted her and had to board her for a couple days. The boarders mentioned they put her with a puppy and the puppy ended up hiding in the corner. She was only about a year old at that point and has definitely calmed since, but not enough that I think she won't get a bit overbearing with the new puppy. I intend to do a bit of a slow intro once the new puppy is in the house (keeping them in separate rooms, but slowly adding sight then touch so they can get used to each other). My only concern is that when we meet the puppy so the shelter can make sure we are a good fit, that she will scare the puppy and then they won't let us have her. 

  
Does anyone know of some things I should do during the interaction (ie, keep her leash tight vs loose, have treats, admonish her when she is being too much)? Or do you have more insight to the puppy adoption process to think that this isn't something I should be concerned with?

And Maple, an 11 month old dachshund (both dogs are fixed/spayed)

They are generally best buddies, they play together on and off all day, sleep on one another in their dog bed, share toys etc. like generally 95% of the time they really enjoy each other.

Ive tried to remove triggers that cause the resource guarding but they include: my bed (both dogs slept with me every night until Maple started guarding the bed with me in it from Finn), myself (areas that I sit in like on the floor, couch etc Maple guards me from Finn) so I crate Maple at night and only Finn gets to sleep in bed with me. 

Today I witnessed for the first time Finn drinking water and Maple came over, he growled, got stiff the whole thing and instead of taking his growl as a warning she lunged at him and a fight happened.

My trainer that I was supposed to start with lost a family member so shes unable to begin right away but any advice in the meantime would seriously be so helpful.

2023-10-25,1698214557,My best friend's dog won't stop peeing in my apartment,"Hey Yall

I have had a best friend for several years. I think she's a wonderful person and have no ill will against her. We both have dogs who get along great. It works out because we have a working relationship of being each other's dog sitter.

A couple years ago I moved into a new apartment, and her dog has started peeing on my couch whenever I watch her. This has not been a problem before this apartment. Right now I'm watching her again. I've had her dog for a little over a week now, and she's peed on the couch 35-40 times. I'd guess it's been 150-200 times or so since I started living here. Luckily I have a futon and can clean the cover, but the cushion is absolutely ruined. I have pee pads on the floor, and (only as of this past week) I have a washable pee cover on the couch that my friend bought (to put a bandaid on the issue rather than addressing it head on at home). My apartment stinks and it's affecting my own dog because she can't hang out where she usually does.

I can't lie, I'm starting to have very strong negative feelings towards this dog. Today, she peed on something very valuable to me, and at this point I just don't think I can watch her any more. My friend refuses to do the hard work of training her dog at home, or even crate training her. Her apartment literally smells like dog pee everywhere. I am at my wits end. I need to tell my friend how I feel, but I also don't want to ruin our friendship or sabotage the chances of her watching my dog in the future. For the record, my dog is well behaved and does not pee on anything.

Both of our dogs are old, maybe 15-16 in age, but I've watched her dog pee enough times to make a relatively educated judgement that it is purposeful and not accidental. She pees wherever she sees my dog hanging out. She clearly controls it by location (following my dog around to mark territory) and makes sure no body is looking.

I've tried crate training her myself but she legitimately goes psychotic in the crate (and I often times have to clean up things that make me gag and come very close to vomiting). 

Sorry for the rant, Any advice? I love all dogs, but I can't help but really disliking her dog. I'm trying to not blame the dog but I'm frustrated. I know my friend has TRAINED her dog to pee on pee pads at home, which has trickled into her couch and bed, and often times she doesn't even walk her in the morning when she goes to work. I'm not so sure she walks her enough times during the day at all and maybe has been lying about it. I'm going to go insane.

2023-10-25,1698255853,Recommendations for Dog Breeds,"Hello everyone! I have been going back and forth on what dog breeds would be good to own for the future. I want to eventually (as in 2-3 years from now) get a dog that I can take out with me and feel safe with walking around as a small female. I need a dog that has some size to it and has that ""look"" to it that encourages people to stay away, but also a realistic breed that I can work with as a small woman. I would like to get this dog professionally trained in obedience to take with me to a lot of places, and one that is calm and confident in themselves. By calm I do not mean lazy or super low energy, as I would also love a dog that I could go to sport training classes with once a week (like dock diving).  I also own a cat, and absolutely need a dog that can get along with other animals. Here below is the filled out questionnaire, and I would really appreciate any recommendations or feedback!

\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\*   
  
\* A lot of different breeds, including the Doberman, GSD, Rottweiler, etc.  
  
\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\*   
  
\* Not quite a ""protection dog"" as in trained in that line of work, but a dog that serves as a deterrent by their confident and calm demeanor and looks. A dog that can be trained in obedience and is known to be reliable and not overly aggressive to people and pets.   
  
\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?  
  
\* I have owned a pitbull previously, and she was a great dog, but she did not have that calm confident energy that I am looking for. She was more of a fun wrecking ball and not a lot of natural focus. I trained her with basic commands. For this future dog I would like to get professional obedience training.  
  
\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?   
  
\* Absolutely! I 100% need a dog that can learn to live with other dogs and cats. I plan on living with other dogs and cats for the rest of my life, and I need a dog who doesn't automatically want to kill other animals.  
  
\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*   
  
\* No children, and I don't imagine I will have children visiting.   
  
\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?  
  
\* By the time I get this dog I will own my house and have a fenced in yard, which is why I am going to wait 2-3 years.   
  
\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  
  
\* I have a boyfriend who likes dogs, but is a bit nervous around animals in general. While this dog will be my personal pet, he might occasionally have to walk them- so, again, that confident calmness would be crucial.   
  
\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*  
  
\* Rarely, however, I don't want a breed that is so suspicious of people naturally that it would lunge out and attack the first person it sees in its territory.  
  
\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*   
  
\* I prefer a rescue but am also realistic about my expectations. I am okay with getting a puppy from a reputable breeder.  
  
\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   
  
\* Either a puppy or young adult, as they will be easier to teach (especially to not chase my cat) and I want to put a lot of training and time into my dog.   
  
\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)  
  
\* Looking for a dog 50-150 pounds.   
  
\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   
  
\* I do not want a yappy dog. A little barking is fine, but I do not want a LGD.  
  
\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  
  
\* A lot. I do prefer the looks of a long-haired breed, and I find brushing pets to be really soothing and relaxing. Also willing to research proper grooming techniques and invest in professional tools.   
  
\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.  
  
\* Any amount of shedding is fine.  
  
\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*   
  
\* Yes to both.  
  
\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*   
  
\* I strongly prefer less slobber, which is part of the reason that I am more hesitant on a rottweiler. I don't care about farts.  
  
\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*   
  
\* Pretty easy to please, as I want to do extensive training with them and occasional sports. Being a small female, if I am getting a large breed of dog I need them to want to listen.  
  
\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*   
  
\* Obedience and some sport.  
  
\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\*   
  
\* Aggression towards other animals for sure. I want to be able to trust my dog around cats, other dogs, and maybe even chickens (as in the chickens are in a coop, and I can trust my dog not to try to break in to kill them).  
  
\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   
  
\* Very important.  
  
\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   
  
\* Can exercise my dog for an hour on the weekdays (would like to do bike rides with them and walks) and would like to do dog sports on the weekend (maybe dock diving, frisbee, or agility).  
  
\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   
  
\* 30 minutes each day, not counting exercise time.  
  
\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*   
  
\* In the house in a crate (after crate training) when left alone, and sleeping on a dog bed besides the people bed on the floor.  
  
\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*   
  
\* About 6-7 hours on the weekdays.  
  
\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*   
  
\* Yes, especially if they are a puppy!  
  
\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).  
  
\* East coast US  
  
\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?\*\* Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.  
  
\* Planning on moving up north of where I am now, so this is a hard question to answer. Probably 85 in summer and 50 in winter.  
  
\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\*  
  
\* 10, when I am ready to get that dog in 2-3 years.  
  
\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*   
  
\* Yes.",dogs,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17gajki/recommendations_for_dog_breeds/

\*\*Introduction\*\*

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

**\* No. Have owned two dogs in childhood.**

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

**\* Would prefer a reputable breeder.**

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

**Loving, affectionate, calm, small, doesn't need lots of exercise, and doesn't bark too much (or can be trained not to bark too much). Health is also important, so we'd prefer not to get breeds that have known health issues (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a great example of a dog we love, but has known genetic health issues).**

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

**Japanese Chin** \- loving, affectionate, calm, and doesn't bark too much. Only issue is shedding.Toy **Poodle** \- Similar to above. Biggest concern is that I've read that they bark a lot, and are very high energy.

**Cavalier King Charles Spaniel -** This was eventually ruled out because of their known health issues. But this is a really beautiful breed that has most of the traits that we really want in a dog. It's just the health issues that seem unworkable.

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**Training it not to bark too much is important. I know that dogs bark, but I just would hate to have my neighbors endure hours of barking.**

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**No**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

**Probably 45-120 minutes a day. That would include a walk, feeding it, and playing with it.**

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**Probably an hour max. More realistically, 30 minutes. Maybe a bit longer on weekends.**

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**Open to brushing a few times a week. Not as open to the other stuff.**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

**Very small. Toy sized ideally**

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

**Obviously, the less the better. But I also understand that it's a reality of owning a dog.**

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

**Not important**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

**Snuggly**

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

**Probably a combination, but slightly more leaning towards eager to please.**

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**Ideally calmly, without barking, but I know that barking is a reality of owning a dog so it isn't a deal breaker if they bark in this particular context.**

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

**Would prefer not to, but will do what I have to.**

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

**I can't deal with excessive barking. An occasional bark here and there is fine (like if someone rings the doorbell or comes onto the property). But I have neighbors that I want to be fair to.**

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

**We work from home, so we can tend to the dog pretty often. Between the hours of 9-5 our availability will be far more limited, but we can take little breaks to do things that the dog needs.**

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

**The dog should not bark excessively. It's okay if it barks when the doorbell rings or if someone comes close to the house (that is acceptable but not ideal). But it can't be barking for several minutes at a time at nothing.**

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

**No**

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\*\*No, but we may have children in the near future.\*\*22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

**Yes. The dog must be small.**

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

**Not applicable.**

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**75-80 degrees fahrenheit (27 C) in summer, 55 degrees in winter (13-14 C)**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**The dog must not have genetic health defects. Of course, any breed has its issues with health. But there are some breeds that have known genetic health defects that we want to avoid. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one example of this. Would be great if the dog is hypoallergenic, but this is not a deal breaker.**

He loves every dog he meets, but I know he can be a lot at first. He plays very well with my in laws lab.

I lost my golden ret 3 days ago and its been really really hard. She had an attack about a year ago but I was at uni so I didnt really know what happened because my parents told me after everything was stable. The vet diagnosed it as a chemical poisoning but also suspected a kidney/liver issue. I live in a small town and animal medical care isnt the best. She wasnt the same after that, she still loved playing around and going for walks but she got tired really fast. We took her to the vet a month ago and he diagnosed her with arthritis and low haemoglobin and gave her some meds for it. She wasnt as active as before but she was still happy and playful. The day she passed, she was pretty active the entire day but she skipped her meal. In the night, she started puking a lot and we couldnt take her to the vet or an emergency hospital because they arent open post 8. I put her on my bed so she could be more comfortable and she just kept looking at me. She started struggling all of a sudden so I put her on the floor because I thought she was feeling nauseous. All of a sudden she couldnt move at all and I started freaking out and called my mom and we tried to help her. My mom told me these were the symptoms she had before she had her first attack last year. My dad wasnt home because he was out of the country and I started freaking out because I knew there was no way to get medical help right now. I asked him to send me a vets number and my mom talked to her and she sounded very irritated that we had called and when we described the symptoms, she told us to give her some electrolytes and that she would send some medications to give her. But she never sent me the medication and when I called her again, she never picked up. It was 11 in the night so that was understandable, but you have a certain responsibility as a vet right? She had a seizure a few minutes later and I think she lost consciousness and she passed away a few hours later. Its been really hard because she was my baby. I was 15 when I got her and I spent all my teenage and young adult angst and happiness with her and now she doesnt even exist in this world. Im not an affectionate person but I was very physically affectionate with her and I dont know how to recover from this. I dont think I can ever love someone the way I loved her.

2023-10-28,1698529577,Future Family Dog- Bigger Breed are a,"(Edit for spelling. Sorry for my misspelling and typos. This long questionnaire is hard on my phone)

What are your opinions based on my answers?


**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Loads of experience! Ive been a dog owner to big, small, breeder pups and rescues. We always had a family dog and the moment I lived on my own 20 years ago, Ive had a dog. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

While Ive had rescues for the last 15 years, Im wanting to though a breeder this time. We have small children and rescues sometimes come with unique personalities that show up unexpectedly. While I know this can happen with puppies, it feels like a better bet to take.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Not too much exercise, easy to train but not so smart that they ruin furniture because they are bored, not big barkers or high pitch barks, can handle kids (respectfully) playing with them and wont nip if they accidentally get stepped or fell on (basically good with small children), gets a long well with other dogs and possibly cats (if we get one in the future), loves to cuddle, funny/ goofy, and ideally doesnt shed fine hairs. Not a jumper! 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I love the Bernese Mountain dogs because they are loving, smart and low energy. Im hesitant because of the massive shedding, the local Los Angeles weather and most of all, their short life span.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Sit, stay, and down. Were not competing in dog shows over here& just the basics. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

Absolutely not. Our kids are what take up our time, not a dog show. We want a dog that can fit into our busy lifestyle without being needy. With that said, were home quite a bit because of working from home. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We work from home 2-3days a week, we would do training up front during the puppy stage then nothing additional once they understand our boundaries and the basics. Would love to take them on vaccinations they are dog friendly.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

30 min walks tops. Also& arent dog parks actually bad for dogs because it gives them anxiety?

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Id pay for grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

50+ pounds. We want a bigger dog. 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Ugh this is tricky because I know that bigger dogs usually have all of this. I could handle the shedding but I cannot handle a barker. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Not too important but ideally wed have a dog that would stay next to us. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggle! But not a lapdog.  Just one that enjoys being near us and follows us around. We love our pets. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I want one that doesnt give a shit. We live in the city and the last thing I want is a dog going crazy every time the UPS or Amazon truck even drives by.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. I dont want an aggressive dog.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Did I mention I dont want a barker?

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Maybe 8-10 hrs 2 days a week and then 4-5 hours tops on a Saturday if were at kids birthday party, for example. Most days itd only be for a couple hours. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Same as mine. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Possibly a cat and a bearded dragon in our distant future.

2023-10-28,1698529083,Wife pregnant; dog started pooping in house,"Hello! Looking for some advice/answers here. My 7.5 year old Bulldog has never had issues with going potty inside. The last time he pooped in the house was about 6-ish years ago as a puppy. A few months ago, however, he randomly started sneaking down to the basement and pooping (same spot each time).  We moved to a new house 1.5 years ago but he hadn't shown any strange behaviors with the move. I feel as though the move can be ruled out, and the only other reason I can think of is him sensing that my wife is pregnant. He's in good health and recent lab work looked great. This afternoon, we tried to get him to go out to go potty but he wasn't interested. A few minutes later, he's in the basement pooping. 

Has anyone else seen behavior like this with their dog? Could it be the pregnancy causing this?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17inscd/wife_pregnant_dog_started_pooping_in_house/

1. We have a 7 month old poodle mix named Kiwi who is astoundingly smart. She fairly quickly became house trained, and without crate training. She's our second dog, and our first one (a Maltese named Arthur), while not nearly so quickly trained, was, behaviorally, a breeze compared to Kiwi. The problem is, Kiwi doesn't like to hold it at night. She won't go in her pen, but she barks every morning between 4:00am and 5:00am to go out. I feel like she should get at least a little water after her evening walk, which happens right before bed, but then I also worry that this is what's causing her to get up. Although I've tried not giving her water and she still seems to want to go out extremely early. She also cannot STAND for us to sleep much past 7:00am, which is a problem on weekends. What do I do about that? 
2. She is destructive: She has already ripped a hole in one of our couches and damaged various wiring and a computer cord, as well as gnawed around the corners of our house. She has many toys and loves to play fetch. But she still finds ways to be destructive.
3. She steals our Arthur's food, and even confining him so he can eat is a nightmare because she knows what's up and loses her mind trying to get to him. Feeding him has become a time consuming nightmare because it requires constant supervision. She also exhausts him, as much as he likes to play, I feel like his quality of life has taken a hit because he gets so few breaks from  from her. I work from home 4 days a week and those days are easily more stressful than my one in-office day because of Kiwi (and, by extension, Arthur, who I have to ensure has his own time to relax.)
4. Kiwi's energy level requires multiple and long walks each day, and sometimes it's not possible to do this due to the weather or other obligations, but we always get in at least one. It rarely seems like enough, and if it happens too early, she just sleeps all day to recover, and then won't sleep at night.
5. Kiwi and Arthur are the two greatest dogs to have ever lived and there's almost nothing I wouldn't do for them, but I can't constantly supervise their activities. Arthur is easy, Kiwi is the problem. Is there any hope that's going to grow out of this?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17igjzl/calming_down_our_7_month_old_poodlemix/

His best friend is Casper (1,5 years, German Shepard) and they had a misunderstanding. 

Casper is super dominant and gets jealous pretty easily (he doesnt like to play with toys with other dogs, hates when other dogs get attention, even by their own humans, that kind of stuff). They like to chase each other and get along pretty well. 

On their last play date Caspers owners didnt tell us (I guess they forgot) that there is a toy in the corner of the garden. Bowie accidentally laid on it (he wanted to show Casper his tummy) but Casper thought Bowie wants his toy I guess and bit him. It was horrendous Bowie whined and my BF needed to get them apart. But as soon as Casper let go, Bowie wanted to play again (even tho he was bleeding from both of his ears and his chin a little bit) and Casper was super confused and looked guilty or scared too& 

His owners are great, they apologized, wrote us every other day if Bowie is okay& We are not mad at them or anything we are just glad Bowie is okay.

Since then Bowie met his other friends and is still the same - his very best, silly, friendly, self. So we feel extremely lucky that he is not traumatized, and his wounds are also okay&

But Im kinda scared to let him play with Casper again. He still looks for him and stops at his garden to see if hes there somewhere. I think he misses him.

2023-10-28,1698457741,Inappropriate Urination,"Seeking some advice on training resources! I have a 3 year old spayed Lurcher who we have been unable to make much progress on with potty training. For some background on her, we made her part of our family in early April. Were uncertain of her past before us, but we were told she was an outdoor dog prior to us. She did well and had no accidents for the first week, then she started peeing in the house. We established a strict schedule for potty breaks in combination with crating. Over time there were some improvements, but she continued to pee indoors. 

We took her to a vet that the rescue had approved where they did a urinalysis. She came back completely normal. We figured she was just a slow learner and continued with the schedule. Her schedule is potty at wake-up around 6am, again at 11, 12:30, 4, 7, and 9pm. We gave her access to water during the day, but we took it away overnight since she has a proclivity to chug the entire bowl and immediately pee. After months we were only having accidents a few times a week. Then she regressed and started peeing all the time indoors again. 

Her crate is appropriately sized for her. She has no problem peeing on herself and in her bed without hesitation. She will pee on furniture that isnt hers too. Its not marking behavior, shes fully emptying her bladder. Because of the regression we decided to take her to the vet clinic we work at instead of the one the rescue initially sent us to. We did bloodwork, another urinalysis, a urine culture, and changed her food to urinary prescription diet. She has been on the urinary diet for over a month. All of her testing came back normal with the exception of a few crystals in her urine. Those resolved quickly with the prescription diet, but no improvements to inappropriate urination. 

Her vets are thinking this is a combo of mild incontinence and behavioral urination. We will be putting her on Proin and would also like to do some training at home while we save up for behaviorist. Its also noteworthy that she is very dim. No, not stubborn. Really dumb. Shes the sweetest dog, not a single mean bone or thought in her. Ive been working with animals for over half a decade and she astounds me with her lack of comprehension sometimes. Everyone at the clinic is in agreement that its not stubbornness or disobedience, she wants to be good, she just doesnt understand how.

This has worked for me for decades. 
If you don't have a kennel or have stopped using it, you will need to get one and/or start using it again. 

Every time you go to the door and out, say outside.
When they potty outside, say excitedly potty outside good boy, girl or name.
When you go inside the door, say inside, no potty inside.
Then give a great treat and say potty outside good boy, girl, or name excitedly again and pets and affection. You can take a pocket full of treats on the walk with you, but I find that it is too distracting for them wanting to get in your pocket. 
If they don't go potty when outside, they get no treat and go back in the kennel saying potty outside until the next 2 hour potty trip.
If they happen to potty inside, say no potty inside and they go back in the kennel. 
My purebred Australian Shepherd was potty trained in 5 days using this method.
I had my Australian cattle/ blue heeler rescue dog trained in 6 days with this method.
But they are still puppies, and you need to take them out every couple of hours using this method.

I also set up motion detectors at the front and back door

The Royal Canin Satiety dry food was amazing. Like, literally amazing. He lost weight, his stool was perfect, he liked it.

BUT, my youngest daughter has Celiac Disease, and we try to keep our house as gluten-safe as it can be for her. What makes the Royal Canin Satiety work (super-low caloric content relative to weight of food) is that it has so much filler in it, and much of that filler is wheat. 

SO, we've been trying low-fat/low-calorie foods that are also strictly gluten-free (and also pea-free) which is a tough needle to thread. I'd love to find something that approaches the caloric content of the Royal Canin Satiety Support - it really is a sweet spot for us. To get his weight under control with regular ""light"" foods, I have to really restrict the amount that I'm giving him, which makes him crazy hungry and he starts chowing on sticks/leaves/etc.

Does anyone have any thoughts on any specific options? All I can really do is google and search Chewy. My vets are super nice but didn't have any ideas other than switching to fresh food, which isn't out of the question, I'd just rather keep it as a last resort (cost and convenience relative to dry food, also my other dog who's picky already would go on a hunger strike if the lab started getting real food).

We've been going there since the pandemic, so we know most all of the other dogs there as well as their owners. We'd be chatting with each other and keeping an eye on our dogs so that we can pick up after them, then suddenly she will aggressively race toward a new dog and start a fight. These fights are loud and vicious, but they're also over fairly quickly, because everyone in the group will jump in to break it up. But there will occasionally be some blood, and just last week a chow received puncture wounds after one of these fights. (I wasn't there, but my wife said that while our dog started it, other dogs joined the melee. I wonder if these dogs are so used to each other that they've formed a pack.) 

This has always been a problem with her. When we first got her she would get into a scrap maybe once every 6 months. We assumed this was because she was a street dog for the first year of her life. But the issue is getting worse lately, and now it seems like it's happening every 2 or 3 weeks. Just today while at home she went after a new dog that we're dogsitting this weekend. She had met this dog one time previously and there were no issues then, but this was the first time this had happened at home. 

We can't pick up on any kind of trigger for these attacks. Many of her victims were intact females, but not all. Many were labradoodles (which, let's face it, speaks to my dog's good taste), but there are 3 labradoodles in our group that she has always gotten along with. And this summer she got into it with a pitbull who outweighed her by 30 pounds. If we hadn't acted as quickly as we did it would have ended very poorly for her. In fact, she almost never goes after dogs who are significantly smaller than her.    

Since last week's fight with the chow, we have been taking both of our dogs to the park only when there aren't likely to be other dogs there. We've also started putting a muzzle on her, but that doesn't mean she won't fight, it only means she wouldn't be able to bite the other dog. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions? Is there any kind of training I should be looking for?

I usually stay away from other dogs because my dog behaves terribly.  Today, however, another dog owner appeared after a turn, about 1/4 mile away.  The other dog was a husky.  My dog went crazy and, as I was trying to move back, the husky went crazy too, to the point of pulling his owner and making him fall.   Neither of us let go of the leashes, preventing thus a dog fight.  The owner of the husky stood up and started yelling at me that it was my fault.  I apologized profusely and I do feel terribly sorry.  I asked if he was okay and he said yes.  My question: am I indeed the sole person responsible for his fall?

2023-10-27,1698438500,Can dogs have nightmares?,"Sorry if this is a weird question, but do dogs get nightmares?

For context: my corgi and I were recently attacked unprovoked by another dog. It happened on our front door step. A dog came around a corner and dragged us down the stairs and then it took a good two minutes to get it to let go of my corgi's neck.

Obviously it was pretty traumatic for both of us, but my dog has been doing surprisingly well. His wounds are healing up without any complication. He's as happy as he's always been. I was worried about him possibly becoming reactive with other dogs, but so far he is actually more excited to see other dogs now (at least ones he already knew) and he's toned down the corgi dramatics when they greet each other.

The only changes I've really noticed in his behavior is he hides behind me a lot more now. My roommate says he doesn't really hang out with her when I'm not home right now, he just sits and watches the door waiting for me to get back. He also gets nervous going out at night now which I expected, but if something does spook him when we're out he'll stay on extra high alert until the next morning. The main thing and the reason I asked the nightmare question is that a few times now I've noticed him growling and snapping in his sleep. Then when he wakes up he stays on high alert for the next few hours.

I googled it and the answer I got was nightmares, but it didn't seem like it was the most reputable source so now I'm asking here. Can dogs have nightmares?

2023-10-27,1698421648,"How to stop 11w Bichon puppy from jumping around legs on walks, risk of hurting her.","My 11w bichon has just started to go on short walks, basically just training to walk in leash. At some times she does well.

But generally she will at one point get too exited, usually when people has passed us/and or she got to say hi to some of these people. At this point she is very exited and starts jumping, sometimes nipping at my legs, running around my legs and sounding like a little pig with her tiny play-growls. 

I am happy she is happy, but i try to correct this and have time out when she gets too excited, i basically hold her harness and push down her butt into sitting position and just wait until she relaxes. Last time though she just got more and more upset by my time outs, whining and shaking and sometimes wriggling a bit. She calms for like 5 seconds but is still kind of tense. Its cold and maybe that is part of why she is tense? So i start walking her again and she is right back at the playing. 

I am really afraid of stepping on her and hurting her actually. Once i accidentally kicked her when she got in the way and somehow she just thought i was playing with her and that got her going even more. 

A big issue is that when she feels the leash go tight she gets excited. So what will happen is this: 
1. She runs ahead of me, i stop which makes the leash go tight. She will try once more.
2. Then she will bite the leash and start jumping around and growl/playing and just beeing a zoomie maniac. 
3. I try to time-out her crazyness.
4. She will whine and shake. 
5. I let go (maybe too quick?) and she will go off again in her crazy. 
6.  We repeat process above. 

Should i just pick her up? Its cold here in sweden now and i almost feel she might think of it as a reward.

2023-10-27,1698434797,How can I make my anxious dog more comfortable?,"Im fostering this dog, and she has been doing great! However, about a week ago, one of her puppies passed away. I thought she was doing okay after that, but she has become very anxious in the past few days.

She doesnt want to sniff or explore, just stay right by me and look around like shes worried.

-She is crated with her puppy when home alone and overnight

-I take her on walks around my apartment complex and try not to change up the route because it makes her worried

-I give her food in a puzzle feeder when I notice she seems extra anxious

-I play tv for her when Im gone a long while

-Her crate is by my bed so I can keep a close eye on her puppy

-She regularly plays with my dog, and she gets plenty of space away from her every day.

2023-10-27,1698431749,My dog doesn't like when I use my desktop computer.,"Hello everyone,

I've only just now thought of creating a post about it somewhere, although it's been happening for quite a while. Just a lighthearted thread, just something mildly interesting to me and I wonder if you guys have any ideas on why such a thing might be happening.

Well, my dog really doesn't like when I use the computer, my desktop specifically. I am now typing this in my bed on my laptop, my dog tucked in next to me. The desktop is on (so it's not about some weird radio waves or anything of such nature), but if I stood up and went to my desk right now, my dog would become alert, and leave the room once I sit in the chair and/or interact with my desktop. I find this interesting, since when she was younger, that wasn't the case. I can't really put my finger on how long this has been happening for. I'm pretty sure the timeline is as such: before I bought my PC a year ago I had used a gaming laptop as my desktop (since 2017), my dog was fine with staying in the room while I played games or used it, then at some point she started having a problem with it, but it was still pre-PC era.

This may be just her getting old, but I suppose some of you here have extensive knowledge on dogs, in case there is a possible explanation to this. I've considered her having a problem with me talking out loud on Discord, yet she is fine when I do it next to her on my laptop or on the phone, so that's out. The computer is now on and she is sleeping next to me in the bed, so it's not just the computer working (waves, fans, electicity, whatever).

I have no idea guys, she is a very attached dog that hates to stay alone and always cuddles up with someone whenever she can, so it has to be something very disturbing about me using specifically the desktop for her to choose being alone in some other room over being with me while I use my PC.

Looking forward to reading your ideas or questions!

Edit/P.S.: Also, i often watch movies or YouTube on my phone/laptop next to her. People speaking, guns shooting (gaming videos), weird goofy sounds - she doesn't even flinch. I could play a recording of a barking dog and MAYBE SOMETIMES she would raise her ears or wake up and side-eye me.",dogs,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17hu98m/my_dog_doesnt_like_when_i_use_my_desktop_computer/

2023-10-27,1698433446,[Assistance Dog Breeds],"Assistance dog breeds (UK)
25yo. Financially stable part time veterinary nurse looking for multipurpose assistance dog prospect. 

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I own 2 dogs, whippet and S Poodle. I work as a veterinary nurse so a decent amount of experience with dogs but more experience with sighthounds (not a consideration for new addition). 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Looking for an assistance dog (UK) prospect. I currently have a whippet and S Poodle. It would be a multipurpose psychiatric and physical assistance dog (mainly for PTSD, FND/CFS &amp; Fibro amongst other things) 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* NOT Labradors. I love them so much but am allergic. = 
Current cons are (TW Pet Illnesses):
- Golden R: Lots of hair! I work as a vet nurse so not hugely bothered by it but definitely a consideration. Also, I do quite like my unique looking dogs!
- Flatcoats &amp; Bernese MD: Also hairy. They both get cancer = BMD have quite a short lifespan
- Stan Poodle: Absolutely gorgeous but these guys are loopy. Very put off with how easily overstimulated they seem, too. 
- GSD &amp; Collies: Previous bite history makes me kinda wary of the breed, but Im working on it!
- Doberman: Not many breeders in UK. Issues with insuring these with my AD training charity. Crossbreeds: Not a huge fan of crossbreeds because of difficulty determining what you may get.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Assistance dog tasks. Retrieval, cortisol detection and intervention of behaviours associated. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No sports, but technically working as AD. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work 2 days a week. The rest are for my dogs and my self care. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Up to 60 minutes on good days. When I have flare-ups I currently exercise my two using sniffy walks and enclosed free roam as opposed to structured walks which are on more stable days. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Minimal-ish. I have a S Poodle, but pref no more than that. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal, but again, fairly used to it with my job. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important. It would need to hold a stay for public access. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I feel snuggly would be more appropriate here as they would be spending a large portion of their time by my side. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please for sure. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* No reaction, preferably. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not in my household, no. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Only ones Ive mentioned, such as lack of reactivity/barking/noise etc but I appreciate some of that would be training too. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Two days a week I work, but I take my dog with me. They will get toiled before I start work at 8:30 and again around lunchtime, then back home and reg routine can continue. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner does not have any preferences. He will help on poor flare up days but he has minimal involvement with the dogs. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have 2 other dogs as mentioned. I also have 2 ferrets but they do not interact with the dogs and are housed separate. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No. I do not have kids or plan to. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes. None except bully breeds but I wouldnt consider them. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK - 4 banned breeds incl Pitties. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mild?

2023-10-26,1698356592,Whining when were not moving/doing nothing outside,"Hi!

I tried to search online but I didnt find something similar to my dogs behavior.

My dog loves going outside with us but one problem is when we are just staying in place, doing nothing then she starts whining.

For example:

Were walking her and everything is normal but when we have to cross the street and wait for the stop sign, then we have to stay in place for the moment and then she starts whining

She also does this when we are inside the train or bus. If we dont move for a long period then she starts whining.. which is a bit embarrassing for the other passengers.

Is she bored? How to correct that behavior?
Im thinking she doesnt know what to do at that point so I started giving her commands when waiting for the stop sign (sit or stay)",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h7ivf/whining_when_were_not_movingdoing_nothing_outside/

2023-10-27,1698390439,Senior dog being alone during work hours,"Hi Reddit.

About 6 months ago I took in a senior dog, approximately ten years old, mix, mostly German Shepherd. Pretty good health, except worn out hips and knees. He's on pain medication and we're advised to not walk longer than 20 minutes at a time.

My workplace is near my home so I have arranged that on my lunch break I go home to walk the dog. I live in an apartment, the dog, as far as known, only lived in apartments. I have been wanting to move, to a house with a garden.

I have a house in mind, only this one is further away from my workplace making it more inconvenient (not impossible) to walk him at noon.

He doesn't like to get up in the morning, so on my days off, if I let him, he will sleep till around 08:00. The last walk on the evening prior was around 21:00.

Normally I am against leaving a dog alone all day. But now I'm wondering and therefore turn to Reddit.

Is it okay for a sleepy senior be alone for about nine hours? I wonder about his notion of time. Would it be more inconvenient for him that I come home at noon but also leave again (which he doesn't like), or is it better for him to be alone at 1 stretch in that regard?

We got our dog (4 y.o. male basenji) about 3.5 years ago. I was on birth control the whole time, never had a period. I went off bc, got pregnant immediately, so still never had a period.

Had the baby 10 weeks ago and my period just came back. This is the first time my dog has experienced me having a period and he will not leave me alone. If I'm out of his sight, he cries and whines incessantly.

The biggest issue is that our baby sleeps in our bedroom still, in a bassinet beside our bed that our dog could easily get into. He's great with the baby, but I could absolutely see a tragic accident happening while my husband and I sleep from him just wanting to snuggle. So he's not allowed in the bedroom while we're asleep. Which means I'm banished to the uncomfortable couch, because neither of us can sleep when our dog crying non-stop outside our door.

I wanted to know if this is a good schedule for him as I dont want him to feel too neglected. Im also curious to know when I should maybe switch up his routine as he gets older?



6 am: Let him out to pee/poo. 

7:30 am: Take him out for a quick 15 min walk. He usually pees/poos again. Come back and play with him until 8 am. 

8 am: Feed him in his crate. Sometimes he doesnt finish his food until I sit next to him or take the food outside (some suggestions here would also be nice!)

8:15 am - 8:45 am: Put him in the play pen and play with him for a bit or let him play with his toys while I prep for the day. 

8:45 am: Take him out before I start work at 9 am. 

9 am - 12 pm: Let him play in his playpen. Ill occasionally take a quick 5 minute break from work to check up on him (hes in a playpen right next to me) and play with him. Ill also take him out about 1-2 times during this time period. 

12 pm - 4 pm: Feed him, then same routine as 9 am - 12 pm. 

4 pm: Feed him. 

5 pm - 9:30 pm: Let him out to pee/poo then let him play in the playpen while my bf and I relax and prep dinner. 

9:30 pm: Take him out for one last walk before bed.

What might they have done had their human gone undiscovered for several days?

Ive sent in videos and discussed over the phone, however, he says he cant do anything from the video because its practically useless. If nothing yields here, I will drive her the 3 hours to an appointment. 

About 3 years ago, my yorkie developed some weird growth on the top of her head, in between her ears. It started out as an itchy patch that grew within 3 years to be the size of a table-tennis ball. It was diagnosed as a benign Mast Cell Tumor and it was removed 6 months ago.        
About 10 months ago, my dog started acting extremely weird at certain points throughout the day. It was originally an occasional, 2-3 times a week, ordeal, however, recently its starting to become more frequent like once a day, usually at night. At first I attributed it to the thing on her head and just convinced myself the vet was wrong, the ball on her head wasnt benign, it was actually harmful; but that wasnt the case, as we had it removed and the behavior has stayed consistent. 

I cant post videos here, so Ill try to explain it as best as I can:        
Usually, shes your ordinary 10 year old yorkie, maybe even a bit more spunky. She gets all excited when she sees her humans, a bit violent when she sees other dogs, and all tail-waggy-yippee when you call her name or give her attention.       
When she gets in these weird modes she wont even really acknowledge you&.     
She refuses to lay on the tile. Theres a few rugs placed throughout the house so every 10 minutes or so shell switch rugs.      
She lays flat with her head on her two front paws.     
Her breathing looks deformed and forced.      
She twitches her back right leg every 3 seconds or so and sticks her tongue out like a frog every 1-2 seconds.       
Shes whimpers and whines quietly, but its already quiet here, so I hear her (and its annoying.).         
She chews her paws and the middle area of her back, right above her tail, until shes soaking wet.      
Her ears are steadily up. If you call her name she perks up a little bit and looks at you from the side but she wont pick her head up and look at you and she doesnt wag her tail.       
She acts like she cant acknowledge you, like its not physically possible for her, but the instant you say Lizzy (her enemy, lizards) she perks her head up and looks right at you.       
Its odd and super weird to see, but theres nothing so can do for her. Ive tried to feed her people food (her Heaven on earth), pick her up to love on her, let her sit with me, etc. but to no avail; she just runs away from me.         
If youre not around her constantly, then the difference wouldnt be noticeable, which is why the vet cant do anything with the videos I sent him.  She just looks like shes laying there chilling, but if you pay attention to her and know her usual behavior, its sad to watch. She looks stuck.       

Nothing has changed in her routine since this started happening: no food changes, same house, same people, same day-to-day, etc.     
Any suggestions?",dogs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h8ta2/10_year_old_yorkie_started_acting_weird_sometimes/

Funny tho everyone thinks shes a boy so i assume thats cause shes big!

2023-10-26,1698361164,Bark-y dog help?,"Not an animal person and I am not familiar with dogs at all.  If they need to be cared for I dont mind brushing them or refilling their water bowls and stuff like that. Im just the kind of person who is respectful of other animals and their spaces and wouldnt have a pet of my own.

That being said, I am staying with my family who has three dogs. They are all fairly small dogs. I get along well with two of them, they are even friendly and affectionate towards me. The other one (it is at least part chihuahua), however, does not like me (or others, really, besides my mom and dad). It will bark at me if I enter the room, it will come into my room for the sole purpose just to bark at me, it will chase and nip at me. I do not antagonize the dog, nor do I even really attempt to do anything like touch it. I avoid eye contact as I read that you shouldnt if the dog is afraid of you? 

So, I have been trying. I give the dog space, avoid eye contact, I distribute treats evenly amongst the dogs, since she will take treats from me. I dont attempt to pet the dog and when it barks at me I just calmly, ask her to please be quiet. My dad chases her/tells her to go into their bedroom sometimes when she starts getting too barky. 

I dont know what else to do and I feel like I am being a nuisance on the household because the dog really just barks at me for me existing. I just want it to stop, but in a constructive way.",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h9871/barky_dog_help/
2023-10-26,1698361862,[Breeds] First time puppy,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have some experience puppysitting but have never had my own dog.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* I am planning to go through a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I wand a cuddly companion that I can bring along on occasional hikes (2 - 4 hours through forests, around lakes, etc.) and for very leisurely jogs of up to 5k 2 - 3 times a week.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have tried to do research (I'm a planner) and am stomped on what breeds are really suitable. In terms of looks, I love Caucasian Ovcharkas or Malamutes but these are neither suitable to my climate, nor would I be able or experienced enough to provide enough enrichment and training.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I plan on doing continuous obedience training for basic commands and so the dog can safely be brought along to friends and family and on hikes and such. I am not interested in tricks or show style training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, other than the aforementioned mild jogging and hiking.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I expect school / intensive training 1 - 3 times a week during the first few months, slowly tapering off to once a week once the pup is grown. I plan on bringing the dog along for most things. The only regular occurrence where they won't be able to accompany me will be to the grocery shopping. During this time and other occassions that may pop up, such as doctor's visits, I have two next door neighbors who are experienced with dogs that would be willing to puppysit. My sister and brother in law are willing to step in in case I need a sitter for a prolonged period of time. I am able to dedicate an additional hour or so every day to focused playtime.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*  I will have time for at least two 30 - 60 minute walks every morning and evening and a shorter walk of 15 - 30 minutes around mid day. I work from home and my work is very dog friendly willing to accommodate regular potty breaks during the first months. As mentioned above, I go for leisurely runs 2 - 3 times a week, usually 4 - 5k in length. I would love to bring the dog along with me once they are grown. Every second weekend or so, I like to drive out into the country and take hikes in the surrounding area. These are usually between 10 - 20k in length and nothing extreme in terms of difficulty of terrain.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to brush daily and have no problem with cleaning ears, trimming nails, etc. However, if the breed is very grooming intensive, I would prefer to bring them to a professional to ensure it is done properly.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* My sister and brother in law have a German Shepherd and I would prefer a breed that is at least about that size.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I do not mind shedding, slobber is okay but I'd prefer if there wasn't an absolutely excessive amount. I would strongly prefer as little barking as possible.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be lovely if possible. I would prefer low prey drive.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly 100%

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* I am okay with a bit of a stubborn butthead so long as they listen when it counts. However, I feel that as a first time owner, an eager-to-please dog would be easier and safer to handle.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Tail wagging eagerness. My friends and neighbors are lovely and if anybody wants to rob the place, my dog's safety is more important to me than a couple lost possessions.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would strongly prefer not to and would probably seek professional help from a trainer if my dog turned out to have such a temperament.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* My 90 year old nana shares the house, though we live in two separate apartments. She is scared of dogs due to her leg being mauled when she was a small child, but has recently come around / gotten better because my sister and brother in law have gotten a German Shepherd puppy who she has been able to watch grow. However, she is still not very confident around dogs, so aggressive behavior would be an absolute no-no. The dog doesn't have to be around her if it can't be helped, but I would love her to share in the experience.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work from home and my hobbies are hiking, jogging, reading and gaming. The only regular thing I can think of where I won't be able to bring the dog along is grocery shopping and I can have those delivered if need be. I also have two next door neighbors who are experienced with dogs and willing to help out with sitting if need be. My sister and brother in law live an hour away and would be willing to help out with longer puppysitting duties in case of medical emergencies on my part or any unexpected trips or such.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* As mentioned above, my nana is a little scared of dogs but slowly coming around. She will not be involved in caring for the dog at all but I would love for her to be able to maybe come along on short walks, play with the dog in our garden or snuggle with them on her couch.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I do not have any other pets and do not plan on getting any.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* We have several young children in the neighborhood whom the dog would interact with on walks. My cousin has a seven year old daughter who comes by occasionally.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I live in a house my family owns that I'm also part owner of. When my nana passes, my cousins and I will be inheriting the rest of the house and property and plan to sell it. I plan on purchasing a smaller home out in the country when that time comes. No rent planned.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in Bavaria, Germany in a small town.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Average high during the summer months is around 22 - 24°C but we've recently experienced peaks in the mid thirties. Our winters are usually right around freezing +/- 2 or 3 degrees on average but as low as -10°C isn't unheard of.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* My budget is around 400¬ / month for everything excluding an emergency fund and up to 3000¬ for initial purchase and vet costs. I am able to afford the pup due to a recent job change that came with a sizable salary increase. However, I am still on a trial period until February 2024, so I will not purchase the pup before then at the earliest, in case it doesn't work out. I

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

* I do not like ""skinny"" looking breeds such as Poodles or Dalmatians and would prefer a thick coat rather than a breed with very short hair.",dogs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h9hay/breeds_first_time_puppy/

I ended up disputing the charges with Chase, which thank GOD i screenshotted every message, every reservation etc. And finally after a month and a half, my dispute was solved by Chase and not Good Dog.

Honestly, stay away from any site that provides dogs via website. If you don't meet this dog in person before hand, do NOT purchase a dog. This breeder was fully ready to just drop the incorrect puppy on my doorstep and take their money and go.

I have small Japan Chin, and he does not usually play by himself, he like to playfiight as a puppy, but mostly stopped as he went older. Recently i found out that if i do this playful ´´zombie growl´´ he starts growling back a bit, and starts seemingly playing with me. I did my research, and i did not notice any usual signs of stress, his tail is not down, and his fur does not seem to be up. He also never actually bites, he puts teeth on skin like if he were to bite, but never presses, he also pounces. He seems to ´´laugh´´ while doing so, but i know that does not mean anything at all.

During the playtime i try to ´´grab him´´ or ´´pounce him´´ (very lightly ofc, and really just pretend). And he does the same back. He does not mind taking treats right after the play from my hand, even asks for them.  


All of that seems like a play to me, but i dont want to risk stressing my dog, or make him feel actually threatened.

My 2 year old Jackapoo pulls hard on every walk to the point you can hear it in her throat and sometimes choking (despite being on a harness that isnt adding pressure to her neck). This is really strong pulling. 

Ive tried the stop walking trick and wait till she loosens the lead as she comes towards but theres one problem&

If I stop walking, she just sits down with the lead still tight. She will not come towards me. 

If I lure with food, she will often come towards me but then seemingly never learns that she needs to stop and come without food. 

Has anyone got any advice on dealing with this??",dogs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17k1994/jackapoo_pulls_on_walks_but_usual_training_method/
2023-10-30,1698694125,Terrier breed rec,"Im nowhere near ready for another dog, so mostly doing this for fun. I potentially want another dog a few years from now. I have one miniature schnauzer whos almost one and I love him and his terrier energy  I dont care about this two brain cells and his barking, so Ill probably be looking for another terrier. Hes dog reactive, so Id like to train him to be more neutral long before getting another dog. He loves playing with other dogs when he gets the chance to safely and is not aggressive at all.

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have a 10 month old mini schnauzer. Hes got basic obedience down and I use r+ training methods. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Responsible breeder. Unfortunately, I got my current dog from a byb and know how to prevent that in the future.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* a small and sturdy dog. Someone to go on hikes with, long walks, play kinda rough with and very eager to please. Im getting into dog sports like agility and nosework, so a dog that likes to try new things and has a lot of confidence.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Almost any terrier (minus APBT/Staffies). Im not opposed to another mini schnauzer, but wondering if theres anything else thats a tad less prone to reactivity but still has the drive, playfulness, friendliness and energy level as my mini. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Hopefully the CGC skills, tricks, basic obedience

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* agility and nosework, which Im taking lessons for now, but Id also like to try rally (no experience)

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* currently, about 2-3 hours 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same, my mini gets about 2 hours of physical exercise. I love sniffy walks, dog sports and homemade obstacle courses. We dont do dog parks.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing every 2-3 days, and using a groomer every 6-8 weeks

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Small-medium (no smaller than a min schnauz and no bigger than, say, an Airedale)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* no shedding, no slobber, ok with barking. I have a barky breed but he honestly doesnt bark unless hes reacting to something. I know a corgi and a Dachsund that just bark all day at home for no reason. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* not important 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Obviously Id prefer a calm dog in this area, but my schnauzer is not lol. I usually keep him him a crate when guests come and let him out when hes calm

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Resource guarding, dog/human aggression (hence no Pitbull/staffy)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* A few hours every couple of days, I work from home

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I love with my bf bt hes in grad school so not involved in caretaking or training much 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* A mini Schnauzer 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes; N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* US in the PNW

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

2023-10-30,1698698367,"UPDATE (and good news): My dog passed away, first time loss, I have some questions.","Several months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/s/JGJo9uJyag) asking for guidance after my dog passed away. You all were absolutely wonderful and so helpful. 

One user (whose name I'm trying to find, will edit when I do) made us a beautiful portrait of my dog. I had it made into some magnets for my fridge. When we moved shortly after he passed, his face was one of the first things I saw in our new home. It helped immensely. 

Many people had stories to share, advice, and things to be aware of. It helped me so much to read these and know what kinds of feelings I might have over time. 

Well, after about 5 months, my partner and I have adopted a new dog. He is a lab mix, two years old, and very affectionate. He shares some things in common with my last dog - for example, he also doesn't mess with our stuff, and he is also incredibly empathetic. He's also different in a lot of ways - he cuddles more and has a bit more energy, but not too much for us to handle. 

A dog-shaped hole in my heart has been filled, and though this new dog has not replaced my old one, he's occupied that void that was left after May. 

Some of the advice I was given, I even look back on now - how it's okay and normal to feel guilty when you learn something new that you wish you'd known for your previous dog(s), and how it feels this new one was sent my by old dog. We're doing very well, and loving life with our new friend. Thank you all SO MUCH for your support.

Im going to start off by saying I'm not sure if this is allowed or even the right place but I need help. I live in a rural area in a that produces a lot of stray dogs.  Shelters in my area are overrun with animals and animal control is a joke.  So there is a couple of stray pups that have showed up at my house.  The male won't come close but the girl pup is so sweet. They are both extremely underweight.  We've managed to get the female to eat and she's staying around our house now. But she looks like she needs medical care. Maybe mange?  My wife and I have thought about maybe trying to keep her because we've been looking for a dog but haven't really had any luck in with it. Plus we have a 3 y/o and his safety is paramount to all.  So my questions are as follows. 

1.  Should we just try to rescue her? 
2.  If so will she always have stray tendencies?  Like to run off or something?
3.  Should we just call animal control and let them try to catch the pair?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17k1t5w/advice_on_stray_puppy/

2023-10-30,1698682874,Treating Separation Anxiety,"Long story short I'm going through a breakup and have moved to an apartment with my dog. This is the first time in his life that I'm the only person he has, he doesn't have free access to a yard, and there isn't another dog around.

All this combined has led to him becoming a ""velcro dog"". When I'm home, he's with me 24/7 and has to be in the same room as I am. If I leave the apartment, he immediately starts to panic. He barks continuously and then begins howling. Obviously this is problematic as I don't want to get a noise complaint and possibly get kicked out of my apartment.

Does anyone have suggestions for what I can do in this scenario? For the short term I'd like to get him started on some medication so that I can at least leave my apartment without worrying about him. Other than that I've been reading up on methods of training him and working on the anxiety, but that will take some months to get worked out and I'd really like to be able to go places.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jx77j/treating_separation_anxiety/
2023-10-30,1698682697,"Advice for Breeds for Mediterranean climate, (kinda) first time owners","\*\*Introduction\*\*  
**1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
\* Yes/no. My partner has had a dog for most of his childhood/teenage years and he took care of taking her out for walks for most of those years. So no direct experience being the sole owner, but a realistic expectation of what is required especially in terms of time.

  
**2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?**  
\* We'd rather start with a puppy, so we'd prefer going through a breeder.

  
**3)	Describe your ideal dog.**  
\* Healthy, friendly, intelligent, cuddly, roughly in priority order. Short hair, both because of shedding and the hot climate of southern Italy where we'll live. Medium size with the exception of lanky breeds like the greyhound which we're quite interested in!

  
**4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
\* These are mostly aesthetic preferences because while we've googled them a bit, we haven't found definite character assessments, but: greyhounds, we just like the look and feel they'd be well suited to the climate. We like what we've heard about border collies in terms of intelligence, but we feel they're too long-haired. Then some assorted breeds we haven't researched but like the look of and the little we've heard about their temperament as well: labrador and pointers.

  
**5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
\* Being well-heeled would be top of the list for me. Getting to the point where I can trust them off the leash in the right situations (hikes, etc) and trusting them not to strain at the leash constantly when they're on it. Also, keeping the barking in check insofar as it's possible.

  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
\* Nope!  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  **7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
\* Both me and my partner work from home, it'll be a fairly large house on two floors. So we are going to spend a lot of time with them, and we're looking forward to dedicating a lot of that to training and playing. I'd say comfortably a couple of hours of intense interaction daily and more casual playing throughout the day.

  
**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
\* Apart from playing daily in the house and the garden as per the above, and weekends outside/park/hiking weather permitting, probably only two daily walks around the neighbourhood. Impossible to quantify right now as we don't live there yet, but we'll make them as long as recommended/necessary.

  
**9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
\* For ill or luck we'll live literally next door to a pet groomer's shop, so there's that. We'd still like a dog that doesn't require a lot of brushing, but we'll have the time and the disposition to do most of it at home!  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
**10)	What size dog are you looking for?**  
\* Medium, but I'm not sure where some breeds fall. One breed that I consider large that I'd like is the Greyhound.

  
**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
\* Shedding and barking are what I'd like to limit as much as possible.

  
**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
\* Important for me, even if it takes a long time to get there.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
\* Snuggly!

  
**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**  
\* The latter, we'd love a loyal dog that sticks to us, outside and inside.

  
**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
\* Ideally in fantasy land a dog that loses its crap at intruders and can differentiate between guests and intruders. That having been said, more realistically, if we had to choose we'd go with friendly dog that snuggles against the burglar. 

  
**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
\* Definitely not. That is, we'd rather avoid that as much as we can.

  
**17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
\* Apart from the obvious (aggressiveness) really only barking and the kind of hyperactivity that makes it tough to keep calm at the leash. My partner had a beagle growing up and he has some horror stories.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
\* Virtually never, we both work from home.

  
**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
\* My partner will take care of them just as much as me and we're making this post together.

  
**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
\* No other pets  
**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
\* Eventually we hope so! No plans yet but we do want to have kids.

  
**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
\* We'll be owners.

  
**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
\* Italy, I'm not sure but I'm confident it won't impact the choice of breed considering our preferences.

  
**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
\* Summer: around 90 to 95 degrees, Winter: around 55 degrees.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

  
**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**  
\* Nothing really

She's very old and sweet and I like her generally. A few weeks ago we took in a stray dog. About 3 days ago, the neighbor's dog started sitting outside our house and peering in the windows at our dog. She now hangs out outside our house all day. They aren't aggressive towards each other so I don't mind. My dog also doesn't seem to care and ignores her. 

The problem is she barks at people. Anytime someone walks by or a car passes she'll start barking.

Our dog is/was very chill and quiet and well behaved. Except now whenever the neighbor's dog starts barking, he starts barking too. He never used to bark at people or cars. 

Telling my neighbor to keep the dog away is not an option. Ideally i could like to train my dog to not bark when the neighbor's dog starts to bark.

Today, I tried distracting him and taking him into another room and doing some training when the neighbor's dog started barking. That worked the first time. The second time she started up barking he couldn't focus on me at all so I took him into the bathroom with me and closed the door until she was done. I'm worried if I don't address this asap, it'll become really difficult to stop.

Both animals seem to be unhappy. The cat seems to be quite depressed, I had to rush him to the vets yesterday because he stopped eating and has been really lethargic but the vet said he is healthy. I think my cat is depressed because of the dog. 

I've had the cat for years he is my absolute world and when bringing a dog into the home it was vital they would get along. The dog is really cute and I love him but am worried this may be the wrong fit. I also think the dog may be miserable.

I know it's only been a month but with the cat not eating I'm worried things will only get worse, I also I know the dog had a few families wanting him when I adopted and I feel he would be happier with another family that maybe has another dog and a garden.

He stops playing with his bone and jumps on the couch with me. He's sitting there calmly so I treat him for good behavior. He then starts staring at my pocket, I am aware the situation is headed south. He snarls when I try to move away. 

I responded by getting up and leaving the room, going to the kitchen instead. He follows me in there, I ask him to sit and he doesn't listen. He snarls at my feet as I walk around. I step outside for 30 seconds (P-). I come back in and he's still gaurding. I ask him to sit and he listens (+R), and I do it one more time.

2023-10-30,1698678161,Struggling with accepting that I need to rehome one of my dogs,"My partner and I started off with a dog and a cat 5 years ago. At that time we were living in a 1200 sq ft apartment in the city. The dog is a 55 lb male ACD/bully/boxer mix with so much personality and is probably the smartest dog I've ever been around. We realized early on that he does not like kids, strangers or most other dogs and just accepted it for what it was. He liked to play with other dogs at the park and daycare, but any dog on his territory or near his people was an issue. He bit my 6 year old when we first got him and that caused us to really ramp up on training and learning about dog behavior.

Fast forward four years and we bought our own house with a fenced yard. We almost immediately adopted a second dog. She's a sweet Aussie/GSP mix that doesn't have a mean bone in her body. there have been 3-4 altercations in the past two years, mostly over resource guarding that resulted in the female bleeding and needing stitches. Now the girl wants nothing to do with him since she quickly learned that he can snap with little to no warning.

This year we had the opportunity to rescue a pure bred male Aussie that was maybe 8 months old when we got him. He was innocent and sweet but completely wild. His training has been going well but he lacks most forms of dog manners. The female is unbelievably tolerant of him and they have formed a strong bond. But once again the older dog wants nothing to do with him and there have been several fights that broke out without warning resulting in trips to the emergency room. One of these issues was a three way dog fight that resulted in me needing stitches too.

The two newer dogs have their squabbles too but its minor growls and air snaps. When the older dog is involved there may be a second of him showing his teeth and then he's causing damage. He has learned how to hurt others vey fast, usually going for the face or the neck and always walking away without a scratch. The other two are afraid of him now. We have baby gates in every doorway and the older dog is never around the others unsupervised. We have been working with a behavioral trainer for a while and have put the older male on meds for aggression and the female on meds for anxiety. the meds help a little but the work with the trainer has been great for the two younger dogs.

Last night was supposed to be an end to a great weekend. But the oldest dog snapped again while he was being transferred into the room that he eats dinner in away from the others. Our newest dog got it pretty bad on the leg and ear and is going to get looked at today. We're pretty much at our wits end with this dog. We do everything we reasonably can to let him succeed but whenever we ease up on keeping them separated he snaps and becomes a monster. The other dogs dont like him anymore. He is secluded most of the day so I go out of my way to mostly spend time with him and not the rest of my family. Its just a bad situation.

I hate myself for thinking about rehoming him. He is my favorite of the three still. But he just keeps hurting them and causing undue stress in our home. Its causing lots of stress on my relationship as well. We're completely aware that if he wasn't in the picture our life would return to normal. No more gates making the house feel like a prison. We come home after work and spend the rest of our time appeasing dogs and mitigating aggression. There is no safe way to have them coexist.

I'll be talking with our vet today about changing meds. However, I'm doubtful that this dog will ever be normal around the others. Has anyone had a similar experience?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jvf1w/struggling_with_accepting_that_i_need_to_rehome/

We chose to get a Labradoodle because my wife has dog allergies and thought a hypoallergenic breed would be the better bet (we know it's never for sure hypoallergenic). We absolutely love him. He's got such an awesome temperament and personality, we trained him to be a therapy dog and make visits to the local hospital together. 

However, since he was about 6 months old, we've been dealing with allergy/gastrointestinal issues. We went through chicken, lamb, beef, and salmon foods, which all ended up causing issues after a while. We now exclusively use Zuke's Mini Peanut Butter and the vet started him on the Purina Pro Plan HA vegetarian diet. A month later, he started throwing up again, so we are looking into trying either the Royal Canin HP or Hill's Prescription Z/D. We've done those blood works that get sent to Texas (Trypsin-Like Immunoreactivity Protein, Cobalamin &amp; Folate Panel - Canine (ChL); it came back all within ranges. If this issue persists, we would have to look deeper into IBD and get an endoscopy, to my understanding. 

It's all worth it because we consider our dog a child and an integral part of our family. But I just want to ask and see just how bad the allergy/gastrointestinal issues exist in pure/designer breed dogs, as our vet had suggested to us that it is the population experiencing the most problems of this nature due to breeding practices. Also, don't you foresee this becoming a more common problem as this kind of breeding practice continues? But again, if breeders don't continue to breed dogs like puddles, puddle mixes, and schnauzers, how could people with allergies enjoy the companionship of a dog? Plus, is there a way to ethically breed these dogs, or is this just an inevitable consequence of dog breeding regardless of how careful? 

Experts, please educate me on what you think of this issue and if you see a fix perhaps by government regulations in dog breeding. ",dogs,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jvbup/just_curious_how_bad_are_these_puredesigner_breed/

2023-10-30,1698676665,Dog Being Targeted,"I have a question for fellow dog owners: has your dog ever been prone to being aggressively targeted by other dogs? 

I have an 18 month old rescued Amstaff and she's sweet as pie. For some reason though, she's already been targeted 3 times by other dogs (usually larger dogs). 

The first time was a husky who was tied out in his front yard. They sniffed each other and then he lunged at her and took her to the ground in a shake bite. Thankfully, she was only shaken up and no real harm was done. 
The second time, we were at the dog park and she was chased by 2 German shepherds. She ran headfirst into a tree trying to get away from their aggressive crowding/herding and I finally managed to get her back to my side and carried on down a path in a different direction from the dogs... Only to run into the same 2 dogs on the way out of the park. This time, they bit my baby girl. Thankfully, not hard enough to draw blood or maim her, and I give props to the owner for his quick recall and for putting his dogs on their leashes until my baby girl and I made a getaway.
The third time, we were at the local park and my girl was playing off-leash with another dog (a lovely cane corso/mastiff mix) when a Doberman decided he didn't like their play and targeted my baby girl and herded her away from the other dog. The Doberman only targeted my dog... Not the other dog which was actually bigger and younger than my dog. 
The next day, we saw the same Doberman in the park and he started herding her just for running around and playing with a rubber chicken and chasing squirrels on her own. She wasn't even playing with another dog... In fact, they were the only 2 dogs in the whole park at the time. 

So, my question is: what gives? My furbaby is gentle as a lamb. She lives with 2 itty bitty Italian greyhounds as her fur siblings and has never hurt them or been aggressive to them. She is shy of humans (was likely abused in her past homes)  and tends to be very submissive. I know she's still a rowdy pup in some ways, but she's remarkably gentle with smaller dogs and is usually neutral towards other dogs once they've indicated that they aren't up for any exhuberant play (older dogs, usually). 
She just wants to socialize and chase squirrels and get her zoomies out... It's not like she's nipping or tackling or harassing other dogs... So what gives? How do I stop this? How do I protect her? Is there some sort of training she needs to be in? I adore her and get pretty upset and scared when stuff like this happens to her... The last thing I want is to have to rush her to the vet because she's been maimed by some jerkwad of a dog for no reason.

There have been no changes that I can see to his health (feet, legs, back all appear normal). Sometimes he walks on it just fine - I think when hes not thinking about it.

I may be able to leave early, but I wouldnt get home until about 2:30 or 3pm. He clearly has some separation anxiety. What can we do?

Long story: our little dog was surrendered about three weeks ago by his owner who had him since he was a puppy. He has been in the shelter and we just brought him home yesterday. He clearly has some separation anxiety, most likely due to the recent owner just leaving him. I went upstairs to change clothes yesterday and he was whimpering so bad when he couldnt follow.

2023-10-30,1698661574,Newly aggressive behavior between new siblings,"I have an 8-9 year old border Collie/blue tick coon hound mix rescue named Penny who my ex-wife and I adopted in 2016. She was intended as both a second dog in our household and as a support dog for our purebred Catahoula named Mycroft who was deaf and in need of companionship. 

A little over a year ago I moved out of the house my ex-wife and I had and into an apartment with Penny.  Because of the nature of the living situation I had to crate train her for times when I had to leave her alone. Most of the time if I left her in the crate she would bark loudly for about 5-10 minutes but would eventually quiet down. 

It's worth mentioning here that Penny has always had separation anxiety of the highest order. She's been on Prozac for about 3 years with it working to dull some of the anxiety but not eliminate it. She is good reactive and will growl at other dogs if they approach her while eating though through significant training my ex-wife and I were able to eliminate with between she and Mycroft. She is also prey-driven and wants to chase and/or kill small animals up to and including cats, having succeeded in doing so more than once with the feral cats in our previous neighborhood.

Fast forward to today where my girlfriend and I have recently been spending more time at her place with the intention of me and Penny moving in with her and her 4 year old chocolate lab Thalia and her 10+ year old cat Mama. We already have a system that has generally been working for negotiating Penny around Mama involving locked doors, outside time for Mama and a crate for Penny. That part hasn't been much of an issue and I've been bringing Penny over for a few days at a time for the last 6+ months without any major issues between she or Thalia. Then about a month or so ago I started being here with her all the time with only maybe one night every two weeks out of the house. All of this seemed to be fine.

The issue started a week or so ago. A piece of dog food was near Thalia's crate and Penny and Thalia both smelled it. Thalia was sniffing around for it and Penny growled at her and went for the food. I thought it would be a one time thing so I scolded Penny for growling at Thalia and we went back to life. As a result of her food aggression returning I started working on feeding them in the same room, separately but still in view of each other, to try to get them comfortable eating together. It was going well then one day at dinner I was holding Thalia's food bowl and trying to line them up for dinner when Thalia got her face too close to Penny's and Penny reacted. She started barking and snapping at Thalia and I intervened in under 30 seconds. I removed her from the situation and restrained her away from Thalia for a few minutes while my adrenaline dropped. I ended up feeding Penny in her crate and it took several minutes to get Thalia to eat. Since then I've been feeding Penny in the crate and Thalia out of it and that seemed to be working.

Now last night the dogs were free in the house with each other all day with no drama or concern. They were in the same room, close with one another with no aggression or tension. My girlfriend was out of the house working most of the day and I was home with them. All fine until my girlfriend returned home and started giving them both affection. Penny started getting very tense and eyeing down Thalia, going as far as to growl at her when she approached her. The tension was worst when Thalia was being rubbed by my girlfriend and after Penny growled Thalia hid in her crate and didn't come out for most of the night. 

It seems pretty clear to me that Penny is trying to assert her dominance but my concern is that she started approaching Thalia while she was in her crate with clearly assertive intent. I feel a bit out of depth with this one. I'm wondering if anyone has any resources on where to find tips for acclimating a dog that already has an established home into a new home that also already has an established dog in it?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jq9t6/newly_aggressive_behavior_between_new_siblings/

Since shes 6 months old, she's been sleeping with me in my bed every night, and she absolutely despised being in her crate when someone was home. She is ok with it when I am away at work, she cries a bit when I leave but will usually settle down in her crate after 10mins. But suddenly, these last two nights, she's been voluntarily running into her crate to sleep at night. If I try to get her out with treats, she will takes it and runs back in.

What's even more baffling is that this change coincided with me receiving a new winter jacket for her last Friday. She's never been a big fan of wearing clothes, and runs away every time when I put out her clothes. But after trying on one of the fluffier coats, she started acting strangely. Once I took it off and placed it back to the shelf, she began whining. I couldn't figure out what she wanted initially, as all her needs were met, but I eventually realized she wanted that specific fuzzy coat. Now, she'll whine if I take it away, and she snuggles up with it inside her crate.

2023-10-30,1698634149,"Advice on a breed for a first time dog owner, thank you in advance","Hi, my fiance and I are looking to get our first dog. Would love some insight on what kinds of breeds would be suitable for us.

1. **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
Yes, this will be our first dog. We both grew up with dogs but this is going to be the first dog that we are completely responsible for.
2. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**  
Fine with either, our priority is getting a healthy dog of a breed that is a good fit for us.
3. **Describe your ideal dog.**  
Our ideal dog would be very sweet and friendly. They would love to spend time on the couch with us, go to parks, restaurants, breweries, road trips, camping, etc. We'd love a dog that is capable of going on 3-5 (maybe more) mile hikes or runs. Having a general friendly demeanor is extremely important to us.
4. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
We both love medium-sized Goldendoodles. They are friendly, we like the look and feel of their coats, their low shedding. We also love Golden Retrievers and Samoyeds for the same reasons, except Goldens and Samoyeds might be too large for us.
5. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
Basic commands and behaviors like sit, lie, stay, etc. Walking without tugging or pulling. No jumping on people.
6. **Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
The only sport we'd like our dog to do is some running. I am a triathlete and it would be great to have a dog that I can run with.
7. **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
I work from home so I'll be with the dog nearly all day long most days. As far as dedicated time specifically for the dog, probably 60-90 mins a day
8. **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
30-60 mins a day of exercise. More on weekends. Especially going on regular runs with the dog would be great. We would also like to take the dog to dog parks and dog beaches
9. **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
Willing to brush 3-4x a week. Absolutely willing to all kinds of grooming at home and yes, also willing to pay for professional grooming and cleaning as needed
10. **What size dog are you looking for?**  
medium sized, about 25-40 pounds. We are willing to flex here for the right breed
11. **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
Would like to minimize all three as much as possible. One of the reasons we love Goldendoodles is the lack of shedding.
12. **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
Pretty important. We'd like to take it to dog parks and beaches
13. **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
Snuggly
14. **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**  
Eager to please
15. **How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
We would prefer a dog that is friendly to everyone. We don't want a security dog and we strongly prefer that a dog be friendly towards bad actors than accidentally be hostile to friends / visitors.
16. **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
Ideally no, friendliness towards other dogs would be ideal
17. **Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
Excessive barking
18. **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
When I'm out running errands, so probably 3-4x a week for a few hours at a time
19. **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
None, my fiance and I live in our own home
20. **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
We have an older cat that we absolutely adore. He is very mellow and calm. The health and happiness of our cat is crucial to us, so a dog with a friendly disposition is a must
21. **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
We are planning to start trying for children next year
22. **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
No
23. **What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
San Diego, CA. No
24. **What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
Typical summer: 70s, typical winter: 60s
25. **Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**  
None
26. **Feel free to ask any questions below.**  
None at the moment

2023-10-30,1698628934,Possible rehoming.,"We, seriously, have an awesome dog. He's sweet and adorable and eager to please. He's a good dog, but we are terrible owners. He's almost 2 and is a chihuahua terrier (we believe Jack Russell) mix.  
About a month after adopting our dog, I developed health issues. These issues are not going away. Additionally, a sibling of mine has cancer, so I'm having to leave more often than I'd like to.   
The dog, for whatever reason, has only bonded with menot my partner nor our child. Our child is autistic, so they struggle to ""click in"" as necessary to bond with the dog, even though they love him dearly.  
My partner works an hour away and, on a good day, he's gone from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. He has tried to bring the dog to the office but he barks nonstop, so he's not welcome at work anymore.   
The reason we want to rehome him is he has turned into an incredibly anxious dog. Ethically, I feel like we aren't doing right by him. I don't like being an ""owner"" I like being a ""family member."" I feel like we are holding this poor thing hostage. If this were a human relationship he'd break up with us or emancipate himself.   
I feel like we have created a prison for him and we are robbing this poor pup of the best years of his life. I'm not kidding when I say I feel like this dog could be legendary. He's the quirkiest little dude. He has the funniest little mannerisms. He's so, so smart. And, damn, he's cute. He looks like a puppy from an elementary school guidance counselor's officehe's THAT cute. If you look at him he throws himself on his back with his tongue hanging out. He's amazing. Someone incredible will adopt him.   
He is so energetic though and it's something we just can't deliver on. We do walk him numerous times a day and I do bring him to our yard to play, but it's just not enough. He needs a family that is REALLY active and where the primary caregiver doesn't need to spend most of their life in bed.  
Can I get feedback on this? Yes, part of me is looking to hear this is okay, but if it's not okay I do need to hear that and potential ways to make it okay.   
FWIW: If we do this we will ""foster"" him until we find the perfect home. We will also offer to dog sit any time they go out of town. ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jhzm9/possible_rehoming/

2023-10-30,1698625721,Super Chewer Advice,"Hi! I have a 1.5 year old lab who I absolutely adore. However, she is hands down the heaviest chewer I have ever seen and lately, her chews that ""last"" aren't cutting it for her and she's been finding other items to chew on, like her bed!

  
I have tried everything labeled for ""super chewers"" and without a doubt, she has gone through them so quick. I've tried yak chews, which she loves, but they last 15-20 minutes max. I even put them in holders to 1) prevent choking and 2) slow her down but she absolutely demolishes yak chews despite the obstacle. I got her beef cheek rolls, which seems to be the only chew that has taken her the longest to get through (maybe 30-40 minutes). She has it down to a science where she will use her front teeth to pick at the chew, in addition to gnawing on it with her back teeth.  
I'm looking for advice on natural chews to get her that will last her awhile! I understand every dog (labs especially) are different, but I don't mind trial and error until I find one that lasts. Also, she tends to hyper fixate on the chew and will not stop until she has finished it, so any advice on how to get her to take a break so chews can last longer?

  
Note - I am looking for natural chews, no rawhide. She has had Benebones and Nylabones which last a decent while, but I really would prefer finding her some natural chews. I even would take toy recommendations, I just want to make sure she's getting her playing time in, in addition to the physical exercise and mental stimulation that I already give her!",dogs,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jgy7s/super_chewer_advice/

My rescue baby, Daisy, a 7-year-old female pit box mix is traveling this Thanksgiving week to meet my family for the first time. She is been with me for only 7 months but she is my everything. We just get along so well. 
She had a very difficult past, Im the 4th owner and I want to give her the best possible life. When I got her, she wouldnt even go close to the car, started shivering, and running away. After the first 3 months of everyday training &amp; lots of effort, now she jumps with excitement to go on a car ride. Im so proud of her! 
We have traveled twice within the state for 4 hours max in the last 4 months but I have realized that she gets extremely anxious when I put her seat belt attached to her harness and does not like the dog bed at all (car or home).
I bought a hammock-style cover and she has access to a full backseat as she likes to move from window to window at times to look out for cars. I recently bought a leash tether tie-down system so she can move around a bit and doesnt feel like shes tied down to something (like I mentioned her past is worse). 
Im thinking of taking the dog bed out and putting a crib mattress in the backseat (Honda CRV) She has not figured out yet that she can lie down in the back. She just sits the whole ride. Even if she lies down, she is back up in a minute. 

How can make her feel comfortable? Has anyone tried a crib mattress for travel? Any suggestions? I tried CBD gummies for her and they didnt help much. I have ordered Holistapet CBD oil.

2023-10-29,1698609694,How did you introduce your adult dog to a kitten?,"About 3 weeks ago, we adopted a little runt kitten as an ESA for my 17 year old daughter named Misa. Eventually, shell be going off to college with my daughter but for right now, she is staying at
at my home. This is the first time Ive owned a cat and so far, its been amazing! Shes the sweetest, most gentle soul and loves my daughter. 

We also have a dog, an almost 3 year old Corgi that Ive had since Jan 2021. Hell be turning 3 on Halloween. His name is Mello &amp; well&.hes far from it. = Hes very vocal, to the point it can be excessive. Ive been training him on my own &amp; with a trainer since hes been here but for how expensive the training was, it did little to improve his stubbornness. Due to that &amp; my own financial state at the time, I had to stop the sessions. Hes very food motivated and smart but hes not very good at listening, otherwise. Hes also great with other dogs- so I thought it would be a bit of an easier transition bringing another fur baby into the home. 

My issue- it hasnt been. Ive done a lot of research &amp; reading about how important it is for both animals to interact at their own pace. And for whats its worth, they have met a few times face to face. But never without one hissing &amp; the other hyper fixating. Before she came, I practiced recalling, positive reinforcement, re introducing the crate when he misbehaves but the moment he noticed her, he hasnt stopped. Now the barking went from excessive to downright unnecessary. 

We have 3 gates, one being in my daughters room &amp; I thought maybe it was for the best that they can interact through the gate. The problem is, my dog barks so much at her that shes scared to come to the gate. I know its the excitement but to someone else or a kitten, it can easily be mistaken for aggression. From the moment he wakes til he goes to bed, he is at the gate. 

Ive been at my wits end. I love Mello from the moment I saw him &amp; the quirks that make him him, but I want Misa to feel like this is her home,  too. After doing a little more research, I decided to get a bark collar which I hope helps because nothing else has(FYI, I made sure there was no shock: vibrations options. It is one with 3 levels of sound frequencies. EDIT: I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SHOCK COLLARS. Its ABUSE hiding behind control. I dont need control of my dog or to punish him for a natural instinct. my goal is to re-train &amp; set a better boundary for my dog) I know this is a long post but I could use some advice on how you introduced your dog to a kitten or just another fur baby in general. dd",dogs,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jb8mq/how_did_you_introduce_your_adult_dog_to_a_kitten/

2023-10-29,1698543007,Breed Questionnaire,"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog. I have no prior experience with dogs.

  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I don't have a preference.

  
Describe your ideal dog.

I'm looking for a medium - large sized breed that is lower energy. I need the dog to be trained at least somewhat easily and I can't have a dog that is to reactive because I have children that come in for a class at my home every day. Also, I'm really looking for a dog that is loyal and supportive of me and my family members. I'd prefer a more cuddly dog, but I'm just as ok with a dog that is more on the independent side. One thing I'm trying to avoid with breeds is an excessive amount of drooling and shedding.

  
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Number one on my list right now is a Bernese Mountain Dog, I think they're beautiful dogs and I love how they're a larger breed that are super cuddly(or so YouTube videos say). I'm also considering a Great Dane due to their large size and more chill nature and loving personality. Other than that, I have been considering a Great Pyrenees because of their temperament and looks. Lastly, I'd love a German Shepherd but I've seen that they can be a lot to handle and I'm not sure if that's for me.

  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I want all basic commands at least. So sit, down, stay, come. I'd also like to be able to train heel and stop commands.

  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, my dogs are going to be purely family dogs.

  
Care Commitments  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

For me, I have at least 4 hours a day open for interacting with my dog. I have a relatively busy schedule both working and studying but I'd squeeze every minute of my free time just to be with my dog.

  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I should be able to give my dog up to 2 hours of exercise time a day if they really need it. It would typically involve walks around the neighborhood or parks that are close by. I'm unsure if there is a dog park in may area but I'd make an attempt to go to one if there is one.

  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I would be fine doing brushing, cleaning of ears and teeth, and of course baths when needed. I will need help of a professional for more sensitive or intensive grooming needs like trimming nails or doing trimming if needed.

  
Personal Preferences  
10) What size dog are you looking for?

medium - large breeds

  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Ideally, I'd like to keep all of those to a minimum, but I am fine with shedding as long as it is not completely out of control. I'd like to avoid slobber and I'd also try to keep barking to a minimum due to other people in my home.

  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I'd love to be able to have my dog off leash because I like the thought of having my dog as more of a companion rather than just a pet. I think they deserve the freedom as long as they don't run away or fight something.

  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'd love to have a snuggly dog.

  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

I lean more towards eager-to-please.

  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'd like to keep growling or barking to a minimum. I want my dog to be wary of strangers but not aggressive or overly defensive.

  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Absolutely, I don't want to be that owner that has an aggressive dog that is a threat to others.

  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I'd like to avoid jumping on people even if it's just being friendly. I have new people and small children in the house quite often so I'd rather try to keep possible injuries to a minimum.

  
Lifestyle  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Almost never, I live with 2 stay at home parents who only go out occasionally for errands.

  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My parents would like a dog that isn't too messy or energetic. Overall, the main thing is to have a breed that isn't wild and to keep all of our furniture intact and undamaged.

  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No we don't have and don't plan to have any other pets.

  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Sort of. We have children come in for a class 4 times a week for about 2 hours.

  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I plan to rent in the future, that is still at least 2-3 years out so I haven't begun researching yet.

  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Valencia, California(basically Los Angeles) and I'm not aware of any laws that ban breeds.

  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winter: minimum 28 degrees Fahrenheit

Summer: Max 110 degrees Fahrenheit

Thank you so much for everyone who commented on my post about this same topic, I found the breed that suits me best and i appreciate everyone who recommended dog breeds to me.

\*\*Introduction\*\*

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\](

I prefer a reputable breeder.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

An active dog who is able to walk/run with me. More on the independent side (as i am mostly busy with sports) but is also okay with cuddling or affection. A bigger dog would be better as i like feeling a sense of protection when walking alone that i dont feel with smaller dogs. I also dont want a puppy, a dog around a year old or older is a lot better for me.

2023-10-29,1698600744,Im wondering why my dog sheds one color at a time,"I have a Border Collie/Australian Cattle Dog mix. I've started noticing a pattern when she sheds. During the spring and summer, she aggressively sheds the black portion of her coat, generally near her back, back legs, and hips. But the white hair on her chest, belly, front legs, and shoulder stay firm. But then in the fall and winter (now lol), she sheds in almost the opposite pattern, with the white hair coming out, and black hair staying attached.  


I'm wondering if somebody can explain why this is. Not sure if it's due to some difference with the colors, the location on her body, type of coat, or something else!

Currently I am first aid trained with dogs, plan to have insurance and get a business license. I have 13 years of experience caring for dogs, grew up on a farm, and am apprenticing in force free dog training as well. I am unsure if I want to go into dog training, but its important to me to thoroughly understand animal behavior and training for my own animals and have other options for career paths if I feel Im a good person for training. 

My idea for the space would be build a couple individual kennels for dogs boarding who are potentially reactive/nervous/need more space, and regular large kennels for the other dogs for settle time/when Im away. But to be engaged with the dogs for most of the days, doing play times and enrichment in the open space of the cottage! Furniture, toys, beds, tv, just an open area for the dogs to enjoy. The only times they would be alone or kenneled would be for a few hours at a time a few times a day. It would be a small kennel, only taking a handful of dogs at a time, but I really want to make it accessible and safe for people with reactive dogs who need special care.

I have two dogs - one is super social and friendly to visitors (friends and family members). He may bark initially at first entrance, but he gets close to visitors, licks them and very welcoming. 

My other dog though will bark and he'll try to get close to visitors while wagging his tail. However, as soon as the visitor tries to reach or pet for him, he backs away and continues to bark. He'll go up to visitors when they aren't paying attention and sniff and be close, but as soon as they look or place a hand towards him, he often will back away and start barking again. He does on occasion when someone is over for a long period of time, he kinda warms up and will appear somewhat comfortable when close to a visitor even being okay with eye contact or petting. Although this is brief and could still result in barking.

Any suggestions on what I should do or how to better understand this behavior? He'll be two years old in February and I feel like he's still young enough to shift this behavior, but I'm lost as to how.

That house has a decent fenced in yard (say 0.6 acres). 

Travel to and from that house is 2-2.5 hours so the dog would have to be fine in a car that long.  I have a big SUV so plenty of room.

2023-10-29,1698581045,help me pick a future second dog!!,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Young adult so I just got my current puppy, 9 mo old Samoyed who is my first adult dog but my family has had 5+ rescued mutts/beagles.  Fostered 8 dogs (4 mos-4 yrs) and dog sit really regularly for people. Experience with basic training: leash, crate, potty, recall, etc but nothing fancy yet. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference, my samoyed was adopted from a local shelter :). 

I am not a fan of baby puppies (under 5 months) so if I went through a breeder especially for working type dogs like Mini American Shep I would look for a program to buy an adult or show dog :) 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Moderate energy levels that would enjoy ~2 hrs of training and exercise a day. 

Ive enjoyed having a biddable dog that enjoys interacting, being able to be taught off leash etc but my life will change a lot and will likely always live in a big city so im flexible with that stuff. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Ive enjoyed a lot of dog breeds, not super interested in tiny toy breeds but 20lbs+ is great.

Dont like Goldens and no doodles. Dont like daschunds, shih tzus, KCS, border collie, Great Pyr, bassett hounds, large hounds. And dont think english bulldogs/pugs/frenchies would keep up with our lifestyle. 

I like poodles, Boxers, climber spaniel, mini american shepherds, labs, larger pomerian/pom mixes, spitzes, shiba, beagles, mastiff, bully mixes (I like the bigger lower energy mixes of like am bully dog, not the smaller pit mixes) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Really strong obedience, CGC, therapy dog work if a good fit. Trick training if they would like. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

Would be fun to try a sport like agility or luring but not sure in the city i would have the time sadly. No experience!

For working dogs I love love them but obviously dont really have the time but i do love Mini Americans. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

4+ hours. Exercise is realistically 1.5-2.5 hours a day and training+enrichment+ fetch in the house. I work from home 3 days a week currently but would always hire a sitter or low volume daycare if they needed. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

1.5-2 hours exercise that is available easily in the city. tons of green space but I am not a running so walking, city hikes, long line/off leash fetch and play with other dogs is a realistic day. 2-4 miles a day of walking so nothing crazy. Im not a runner or biker or anything like that. 

Whats important is I want a dog that can keep up with that exercise and be able to do short hikes - 5 miles is probably max. 

I basically do go to a dog park (owners congregate in an unfenced local park) but i wouldnt go if i had issues with the other dogs or owners. Apartment dog parks are usually 1-4 dogs at a time. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I have a samoyed so 2-3 times a week brushing, self washing 4-7 weeks, and paying a professional occasionally. This would be for the future so if i had the money for regular professional grooming I would. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

20lb-60lb is probably ideal but i could go slightly bigger.  

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not a fan of excessive barking. Others is fine! 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Pretty important. But wouldnt mind a long line dog but I wouldnt want a door dasher in the city. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Medium! Doesnt need to follow me into the bathroom every time or be touching me 24/7 but I like them sleeping in my bed. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Alert barking is fine but I want friendly with strangers but I do love mastiffs =-

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Nope - have another dog and he loves being with other dogs. Dont mind managing leash reactivity. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Separation anxiety or destructive tendencies. 

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I currently work from home 3 days a week and dont imagine i would ever work in an office 5 days a week but would definitely hire a walker and would consider sending them to a low volume daycare or a sitter who has other dogs but that would get pricey for two so ideal just a walker for office days. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Just me. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Samoyed - 9mos. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No but would want kids eventually and they would hopefully still be around 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Yes - not renting now still living with family this would be for the future. The main breeds Ive seen restricted is shepherd, huskys, rottweilers, corsos, danes, akita, pitbulls, am bulldog, some mastiffs. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Neighbor counties ban pit bulls but i wouldnt live there. 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 85-90
Winter: 45 
Summer wouldnt be doing much exercise outside unless they needed it since i have the samoyed.",dogs,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17j1i0q/help_me_pick_a_future_second_dog/

Before I locked him up I yelled at him and told him he was bad for going potty in the house and he starting growling and showing his teeth and I went to grab his head so he would look at me, which I do all the time when I tell him I love him or tell him he's a good boy. But this time he bit me and was very aggressive. This is not my dog. He's usually so happy and loving and he hasn't pissed in the house in over 6 months. He's never shown any aggressive behavior before. Since I let him out, he won't even come near me. He usually whines when I'm on the other side of the fence. He would be miserable without me. I'm disabled so I'm always with him. I don't understand what's going on. Why would he suddenly pee on my rug, knowing what he did was bad and then growled and bit me?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17j0gpa/my_1_12_year_old_growled_and_bit_me_for_the_first/

I have heard that dogs' noses are extremely sensitive, and they are not keen on being booped. And then I see a video of a dog playing volleyball circulating the Internet. How come that the dog likes it? I would expect that it is unpleasant for the dog to bounce the ball with its nose. I would guess that a balloon is ok, but a ball is already a bit heavier.

My girlfriend and I have a very happy and excited ""puppy"", 8 months soon, 50/50 labrado and pointer. Whenever he meets or see people his immediate reaction is to greet them. Greetings usually includes jumping and playful biting in their clothes/hands, and a tail that wags like it's the best thing ever.

There's no evil intentions in him, but we don't want him to get near people because of it. We have no idea on how to train it away, so he at the very least stay on all 4, and that's why I'm here.

2023-10-29,1698574480,Code Brown!,"Hi all,

I need some advice about one of my babies - Cooper.

Coop has a really awful history, he was rescued by my partner from the kennels where he was basically on final call before going to the field in the sky. Originally Cooper was a street dog, he'd been beaten, burnt and just generally abused. When he was rescued from the streets he was emaciated and incredibly timid. Obviously, he has a lot of trauma and that is just a whistle stop tour of it.

When my partner rescued him, he was scared of everything. He cried every night for months and she had to sleep downstairs with him. He struggled interacting with people and would cower at the slightest thing. During this time he had a few accidents, but they seem attributable to my partners ex who would shout at him for various things (in fairness he did half-kill a chicken, so I see where the anger came from).

Over the last 5 years or so, hes become a really well adjusted good boy. Hes house trained and affectionate, he doesn't do anything wrong. He will still cower occasionally at loud noises or if he thinks hes in trouble, but he generally calms down when he realises hes not.

Fast forward to this week - we've had three code browns - all in the hall way, if that helps anyone? - and a code yellow in our bedroom, which occured just after the code brown was discovered so that could probably be chalked up to fear of being in trouble. He was also sick in the living room (just bile)  before the first code brown. He isn't coming to either  of us before the code browns to ask to go out either, he just seems to be taking himself off and doing them.

We need some advice and pointers on what could be causing this and how to deal with it. At the moment we're telling him off and putting him in the utility on a time-out, but that doesn't seem to have stopped anything. There have been no changes to diet or routine. Theres nothing happening which is scary or making him anxious (before the poos that is, I could understand it if it was after he was told off for something), and otherwise he seems to be in good health.

The biggest concern for us is that we have a baby on the way, so this kind of behaviour cannot continue.

Or if anyone else has some other options that would be viable.

2023-10-29,1698562759,Rehoming feels like the only option...,"I've had my girl since 5 weeks old due to her being in a questionable situation. She had worms and the mom was in horrible condition, looking back and knowing what I know now- I shouldn't have gotten involved but wanted to help her. 

Now she is almost 7 months old, fully vaccinated and spoiled... and even though i've done daily training sessions,  walks,  and lots of stimulation things have only taken a turn for the worse. I've watched endless videos from youtube and nothing seems to be getting through with her. I keep calm and collected whole dealing with her, but i've been struggling the past few weeks.

We have 4 cats, and a toddler aged 2 in the house. I thought if I was able to train our puppy properly, that we could all be a happy family. At 5 weeks when she came home, she was running away with her bowl (I didn't know this could be the beginning of resource guarding). This progressed to intense resource guarding from the cats and she continued to eat separately to ensure the cats safety. She's now been chasing them away from the water, and resource guarding the couch by growling at us. A cat walked by her crate while she was eating and she was lounging, trying to attack them. Then she started resource guarding from the humans...

She's also been attempting to hunt the cats, I try redirecting her, but with her resource guarding the water I get scared she will serious damage or be fatal to them. 

So far, she's been okay with my son. She does jump on him, we tell her off and sometimes she listens. Sadly, my two year old has been knocked over multiple times and is terrified of the puppy. She's a boxer/pitbull mix hitting 35lbs, i've even been tackled by her a few times. I'm terrified she will snap on him. No matter how much I love her, I know she is capable of biting.

I've noticed that she never calms down unless crater to enforce naps. Seems almost like she's constantly over aroused, tried getting her to sit and wait for a calmer state as well and I can tell her mind never calms down. It's like she doesn't hear us, and doesn't even see us half the time. She's tramples over us on the couch, and now with resource guarding it i'm scared. Tried not letting her on the couch and telling her to chew her toys on her bed and she got agressive. She's obsessed with the couch.

Outside on walks she's lunging, pulling, and whining. I've tried taking breaks and giving her treats but she doesn't actually calm down.
She doesn't listen to commands unless she sees I have a treat in my hand, however I've had to remove garbage from outside on the sidewalks from her mouth. This has resulted in two bites that broke the skin on my hand and bled all over my clothes.

Recently found out i'm pregnant after trying for a year and a half, and not sure where to go from here. I feel like I can't bring a baby into this situation, and that our puppy is not a good fit for the household. We wouldn't be getting another puppy, ever. I am debating on trying rehoming her to a single pet household without kids while disclosing all of this.

We have an appointment with a behavioural specialist in a week, and I've lost hope. I don't think my cats, and my children will ever be safe with her. I fear she is going to end my pregnancy by trampling my stomach, or hurt the baby once they come. I'm convinced she will kill a cat or hurt my toddler. I feel selfish, i'm just at a last resort here. I spend so long on calm training sessions a day, and with very little results over months- I'm mentally exhausted. It seems like she's too much for our lifestyle and household. I love this dog so much, I fear this will never work out and it's a hard reality to face at this point. I listen to advice and feel like even though i've tried endless ways of approaching things, it's not improving. It feels safest to remove her from the house asap... her mental state is not healthy and I'm not qualified for her:/",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ixbin/rehoming_feels_like_the_only_option/
2023-10-29,1698555392,[Help] dog plays way too rough,"This is probably gonna be long, apologies in advance --

For context, I(29m) am currently babysitting a 2-year-old American bulldog. He's a good boy for the most part, and I don't dislike him, but boundaries are an issue. I housesit frequently and grew up around dogs, so I know how to handle myself and have dealt with some difficult dogs -- but goddamn if he isn't trying my patience.

This dog plays way too rough, and doesn't take 'no' for an answer. He has that bully energy, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but the only ways he wants to play are tug of war and roughhousing/wrestling. And when he roughhouses he jumps constantly and damn near bowls me over, mouths my feet and hands, he hits with his paws hard enough to hurt, and he bites (doesn't draw blood, but has broken skin). I've spoken to his parents, and his mom has mentioned that he roughhouses/wrestles with his dad a lot, so i guess he assumes it's okay to play rough with me too? But he doesn't listen when i say no. Anything I do just gets him more riled up, and if I withdraw attention he goes right back to full throttle. It's also worth mentioning that I'm disabled, so walks aren't really an option and if he actually knocks me down, he could potentially really hurt me. I've tried scent games/nose work, I've tried playing fetch, hide and seek, redirecting his behavior, nothing seems to be working. Every time I sit down he's climbing all over me. I'm at my wits' end, and I still have a week left. If anyone has any suggestions for how to deal with this behavior, I'd be very grateful.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ivnla/help_dog_plays_way_too_rough/
2023-10-29,1698554556,Trying to train my parents dog but my parents arent implementing my training to the dog,"His name is Hamilton and Ive been getting frustrated with his actions lately. Hes been acting reckless and my parents havent been displincing him like saying no! So it doesnt teach my dog what hes doing is wrong. A few examples are when he comes in the house after his walk. He will BARGE in the house and push the door very hard against the wall. They just let him do it and its bad because when he does this it damages the wall. Im hoping I could train him to wait for my command to come in the house in a more calm way? 
I get that hes excited but he ruins furniture when he gets like that. 

Another issue is when im putting Hamiltons food in the bowl. He usually just dashes over and knock me down or physically push me out the way so he can dig in. I like the enthusiasm for a good meal but it gets annoying when Im not done putting his food in the bowl. I tried to put the bowl on a counter and put the food in the bowl that way so he cant shove me when Im kneeling down. I tell him to sit while Im doing this and he listens. But the second I put the down down he does the pushing thing again. I want Hamilton to CONTINUE sitting even when Im putting his food down, I want him to get up and eat on a command. Yk what I mean? 

I just tried to train Hamilton this exact thing today.  To stay neutral/sitting when im putting his food down and when im done i say eat.  It went pretty good the first round. I give him treats each time he moves on MY command.  But he doesnt get it at times and its okay. The thing im worried about my parents uncorportation. I tried telling my parents about me training Hamilton and they said its dumb. Im not surprised cuz theyre the dukbass idiots who completely neglected in training him when they bought him. Ive been the one taking care of his needs, his wounds and bathing him. They havent done shit. The only thing the see him as is an accessory. They LOVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEE the attention they get when they walk him. The only time they walk him is when they want to get attention that day.  They dont talk him outside every day when he needs to do his business because they dont care about his needs. im the one whos always taking him out every single day but they dont think its a necessary.  They barely feed him too, and hes a reactive, reckless dog because of the training he has never been taught. O dont blame him,  they just let him do whatever because they dont care about him. And Im trying to instill training onto him. So what do I do? So if they dont implement my training, then I feel like all the training Im doing is worthless. Im doing all the hard work for them so they dont have to and Im gonna need a little bit of help from them to cooperate with my training but they dont even want to do that so I dont know what to do.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ivggt/trying_to_train_my_parents_dog_but_my_parents/
2023-11-01,1698856983,Firepaw mill vs DogPacer for senior dogs,"I have a couple of skinny short haired senior dog (dachshunds) and the weather gets bad enough here that I can barely get them outside for a bathroom break, let alone a real walk. As they are getting up there, I worry that six months with next to no exercise will not be good for them. This summer I have really started building endurance in both of them, and I would like to maintain that during the winter. 

So which is better? A firepaw or a dogpacer? Im okay with the noise and size and price I f either, and Im leaning toward the firepaw because I really like the dog powered aspect of it. Im a little worried that my oldest wont be able to move it, but I figure I can move it by hand if I have to, but I wanted to know if anyone has experience with senior dogs on either. 

Both dogs can walk over a mile, and all Im hoping for is 15 minutes twice a day max for each. I know that can be a lot at a full out sprint, but they would go very slow, probably 2 mph or less for the older one as needed. 

I also have a younger dog who would love to get some sprints in on the really ugly days, and I would prefer the firepaw for that (I know you can only go so fast on a dogpacer) but hes happy going for a walk in almost all weather. 

Does anyone have experience with either and an older dog? We do a lot of brain training and games, so its purely for physical exercise.

But whatever he stands up and approaches her, or is walking by she runs away. This only happens with him. After she ran away she will come back to him and sniff him. And then go about her day. 

And also, when my dog is downstairs and my boyfriend goes downstairs she will bark at him for a good minute, as if shes never seen him before. 

She was a little bit scared of my grandpa as well, and I am thinking she may be afraid of men? But I dont understand why she cuddles with him, and is comfortable with him when they are laying in bed together. But not whenever he is standing. If she has to walk by him while he is standing, she will run super super fast. Its a little bit confusing bc she seems to love him in bed, but that is it.

2023-11-01,1698858543,I think my dog is uncomfortable around people on the spectrum,"Hello, I have a 10 month old female Dachshund, she is my doctor approved ESA. She is very kind and loves people and other dogs. Last night was Halloween and since she is a bit of a barker I thought it would be good to bring her outside so she can see that its okay for people to come to our house. It went pretty well, she didnt bark but a few times and I had my other friends out there to separate her from the candy, for kids who were scared of dogs. I held her in my lap whenever kids came up and most of the kids loved her and even wanted to pet her. For most of the kids she wagged her tail and accepted the pets no problem. However, there was one kid who came up and spoke really loud and pet her in a poking manner(just touching the top of her head with his fingertips instead of with a full hand). I work with kids and he was a bit older so I could tell he was on the spectrum. She was fine at first but then she started growling. I noticed but I dont think the kid did so I positioned my hand under her mouth just in case something happened. He went to get candy and she was fine but then he came back and she growled again and I think she tried to nip him but I covered her face so Im unsure if she was just showing her teeth. I didnt want to stop him and make him feel uncomfortable because I could tell he was so happy to see her and didnt mean any harm, this was probably wrong of me because I could tell she was uncomfortable. This is my first dog as an adult and I had no idea what to do. Afterwards, she went back to being fine, other kids came up and pet her and she was back to her happy self. The issue I have is that I am becoming an Occupational Therapist and was planning on getting her professionally trained when she is old enough so I could do sessions with her. Does anyone know how to prevent this? How can I normalize her to people that act differently?

I wanted to ask this community if they have had a very anxious dog who is basically scared of everything. I am not sure how do we manage her anxiety with training. 

I have a 6 year old mixed breed dog (she is a stray from Greece more like a hare hound). We got her when she was 7 months old so dont think her issues has anything to do with her past experience, so we think its just her natural behaviour. She always was a timid and nervous dog but we are now concerned its increased recently. Our older dog was put to sleep recently (cancer), they both werent too close and for over half year since he wasnt well their routines were quite different too. But recently we are seeing she is scared of more things than earlier. And when she is scared she refuses to even accept treats or toys to pacify that nothing bad is happening. For e.g. even the slightest of movement or noise in the room she would just get up from her spot and run to another room. While eating as well if she hears even the slightest of noise she leaves her food and hides somewhere in the house. 

We are at a loss what do we do with her anxiety and fear issues. I am worried if this might trigger any other health issues with constant stress. When she is outside on the walks she is her confident self, but this is usually when we are in the woods .. when we walk near a road she is sometimes get scared of sudden vehicle noises (but this was the case earlier as well) any suggestions would be really helpful if they have been able to help their dog overcome anxiety and nervousness.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17lcvdi/very_anxious_and_nervous_dog/

Hello all, 

I currently have a 5 month old Catahoula puppy (f). I have a friend that has had some unforeseen life circumstances come up, and needs to re-home her 12 year old (f) Catahoula. 

The senior dog is in good health, well trained, well-tempered, and moderately active. According to the owner, she is good with other dogs, but may take a little time to warm up to them. 

I have read online that a puppy can either be great or not so great for a senior dog. My puppy is very energetic, but smart. My thinking is the senior dog could serve as a good model for my current puppy, as well as a companion. My fear is that my puppy would be too energetic for the older dog, constantly annoying her and tormenting her final years. 

Lastly, the alternative is taking the senior dog to a shelter. While I feel no genuine responsibility for this and dont have a savior complex, a small part of this has admittedly influenced my thinking. 

So what do we think - could this possibly benefit both dogs, or is this a recipe for disaster?",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17l44rm/thinking_of_adding_a_senior_dog_to_the_mix/
2023-11-01,1698840533,Should I Rehome my Australian Shepherds?,"I (23m) have two (2) 3-year-old Australian Shepards (unaltered). They are brothers that I purchased at 20 years old and have had them since they were 4 months old. For some context, I originally bought them with the support of a partner. We had a home in the suburbs with a large yard, an older more experienced dog, and multiple young cats. 

Today, I am by myself, we live in a small one-bedroom apartment, in a bustling metropolitan. Between work, school, and attempting to have a social life. I am finding it difficult to maintain a good quality of life for them. 

Based on a few incidents, I have begun to seriously consider rehoming them. I personally, can not keep up with their energy. I will be the first to admit, I did not do any research into breed type/characteristics, energy levels, etc& My former partner and I saw cute puppies that needed to be extracted from the situation they were in. This, I feel, has come back to bite me in the behind.

It is a challenge for me to afford all of their needs as well (vet costs/emergency care costs). As well as how much it would cost to board/rover, for out of town trips I want to take. I have completely self-trained, but as they are still relatively young, there are situations in which they have a hard time controlling themselves. I will also admit that our relationship is strained. I do not feel that they have a connection to me (sure theyre excited to see me when I get home, but they show the same excitement for any human/dog they encounter). 

I have heard from trusted friends and family with varying opinions. On one side, I have heard, I have not done enough to alleviate my concerns with them (alter them, walk/play more, take them to doggy daycare). On the other side, I have heard, that they (obviously) are not in the optimal environment and our circumstances will not significantly change for the better for a significant amount of time. Even with the passage of time, my attention to them would only decrease as my chosen profession demands much of me. 

I aim to be transparent in that I am in my early 20s and very much want to experience them. I believe there is a situation in which we all win here. As I am sure you all know, Australian Shepards have a life expectancy of 12-15 years. That is a significant commitment. I again admit, I did not (and should have) research anything about the breed (originally thought they were Golden Retrievers), and I am not facing the consequence of that oversight. 

In all, should I rehome, or hope things will turn around?

EDIT: I do also want to add: As they have been together with each other for their entire lives, any option that is not them being rehomed together is NOT an option. I can not do that to them. ",dogs,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17lamk5/should_i_rehome_my_australian_shepherds/
2023-11-01,1698841201,How do you fix reoccurring small patches of matting on a border collie,"So I have a gorgeous border collie, he is more robust and has fairly long fur and e have this problem where he gets his hair matted constantly even tho I always brush him but around certain spots on his body specifically under his ear on the bottom side of his tail and on his back he os really prone to Matting and as far as o can tell it's mostly caused by small bits of plant matter that might not come out when i brush him but that's just a guess.

Although also brushing and bathing is a big problem too he has so much energy no Matter how much we play or walk or run sometimes he just doesn't get tired but gets bored immediately and cannot stay in one place flr more than two seconds so he isn't stopping me from brushing by being annoyed or making noises at me, he just keep throwing the ball at me or runs away from me to sit down in a waiting position the same position he takes when he is waiting for me to throw the ball but if go there when he is laying down tp brush him he starts sprinting towards the ball.

Also i think he hates water, not when it rains he seems entirely unbothered by rain unless it's very heavy rain but if i try to get pour water on him with a shower head or anything really he acts like a cat.

However, the dog is partly blind and can only see clearly 2 meters before her. We didn't know this until she got home.   


We have been trying to introduce our two cats to the dog inside and it's been going well. They haven't made contact yet but everyone is calm when the chicken is present and the baby gate is closed. The problem comes when the dog sees the cats outside.  She can't really see them and starts chasing them because she thinks it's another dog. She will chase them and if they run, she gets really worked up but if they don't run then she tries to bite them.

Usually I would just stay in the granny flat overnight with our lab so he isnt alone, but I will be overseas at the time. 

My mum has told me she thinks we should let her parents stay in the granny flat, which would mean that our lab stays outside at all times, as hes not allowed in the main house and my grandparents do not like dealing with dogs. Knowing my family, if hes outside 24/7, they probably will not interact with him much. He doesnt have a kennel, just an elevated bed on the deck outside. He would be living like this for a couple weeks. I told my mum that I dont think its fair that we kick him outside so that her parents can get a spot to themselves, and they can just have my room instead, but she wouldnt listen. I will be home the day before christmas but at that point our lab would have already spent a week or so outside, and I dont like the idea of him being neglected like that.

She is very sensitive, and absolutely will not go to the bathroom when its raining outside so if theres a storm for a long period of time we can expect accidents and understand. However, Im getting so annoyed with this new habit of pooping in the middle of the den and I know its irrational but I cant help but feel she does it on purpose.

I give them all Kongs with milkbones inside them to keep them busy while I am working  on something in the house. Today I decided to put a little peanut butter in them. Apparently, that made the treat extremely high stakes and Im not sure exactly what happened but I believe the lab snapped at the Chihuahua when I wasnt in the room. 

Theres nothing wrong with the chihuahua physically, he doesnt have any bites and he seems to be moving around fine but he is traumatized. He was panting a lot and very anxious. The panting subsided after about 30 min and now the chi is aggressively growling and snapping any time the lab gets close to him. 

I tried feeding them plain Greek  yogurt, something they all love, from my hands while the Chihuahua sat on my lap and the lab sat next to me. That went fine but now every time the lab comes close to the chi is snarling like hes going to try and attack him. The lab is 85 pounds and really is not aggressive at all, hes clueless and has no reaction except to steer clear of the chi.

Anyway, Ive heard of this happening when a small dog is attacked by a larger dog but usually thats when theyre picked up or thrown around or something by a strange dog and that is not what happened as far as I can tell. I am wondering if I should keep them separate or try to keep them together and sit with them as much as possible to positively reinforce.

\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  
\* My dad and I will both take care of the dog  
\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*  
\* Not often in fact we are usually the visitors to other people's homes.  
\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*   
\* We have had good experiences with rescue dogs. We have never used a breeder.  
\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   
\* Young is preferable because we want a dog to grow with us.   
\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)  
\* 12 -24 inches is what we are looking for.  
\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   
\* We would prefer a dog that is well-mannered and doesn't bark at every little distraction. One that is used to being around other animals is best.   
\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  
\* Some as long as the dog is accustomed to brushing and doesn't bite.  
\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.  
\* A trim by a pro is preferred. However, one of my dad's previous dogs required regular brushing.  
\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*

\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*   
\* Little slobber and at least quiet farts.

\* Eager-to-please is the big thing.

\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\*   
\* Aggressiveness of any sort.  
\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   
\* Not very due to the risk of other dogs and animals in the wild.  
\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   
\* A walk every day if weather permits (snow/ice during the winter) backyard play or even indoor play. We have access to a dog park as well, weather permitting.  
\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   
\* My dad is retired and enjoys exercising. In the past, he would take our dog on 1 to 1 ½ mile walks every day.

\* A crate when it might be alone otherwise inside of the house on the couch or dog bed.  
\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*   
\* Hardly ever my dad and I are home most of the time and when we are not we will take the dog with us.  
\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy daycare, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*   
\* A dog walker or doggy daycare would be no problem  
\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).  
\* Western Washington state near Puget Sound (Kingston) no breed restrictions.

\* 8  
\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*   
\* Yes. Have had several dogs and cats in the past. Each requires care from time to time.

2023-10-31,1698795308,Breed recs please!,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* I had a dog as a a child, but not as an adult  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* I am currently planning on going through a responsible breeder, but I could be convinced to get a rescue dog if the health/temperment lottery aspect could be minimized (I am far from an expert)  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* I want a dog who would be down for most things. Most of the time pretty chill with one or two neighborhood walks a day - with the occasional hike of just a few miles. Able to play with friends dogs and children. I have cats so they absolutely have to get along with cats. If longer walks would be out of the question, that is better than too much energy. Dont want to have to worry about aggression or destruction.  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* I have always been enamored with the Cavalier King Charles. They are the size and temperament and cuteness I am looking for. However, the health issues give me pause. Have considered dogs liek shih-tzus, but to be honest, the smushy face dogs like that dont really do it for me. Many of the breedsi  have looked out have been ruled out for being too yippy.   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* responsible behavior and maybe a few parlor tricks. Be chill and come along for the ride.  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* nope  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* 1 hour active, but plan to hang out with them most of every day, since I work from home and am fairly homebody-ish  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* Daily neighborhood walk, maybe weekly longer walk/hike/visit to dog park  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* I would brush a few times a week. Probably leave the rest to groomer.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* small to medium. a chihuahua is too small, and a skinny lab is too big. My wife will want to be able to carry the dog if necessary, so it cant be over \~35 pounds  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* dont care about shedding. Minimal barking and slobber  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* no preference  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* mostly snuggly  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\* eager to please  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* nice to strangers. To me, an unnecessary watch dog is a nuisance, not an advantage.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* no  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\* digging, un-trainable jumping, high-volume licking  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* very rarely more than 4 hours. Both spouses work from home   
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* our preferences are shared and responsibilities would be shared. There arent any children  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* 2 adult cats. Likely will always have at least one cat  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* no, but need to be able to occasionally due to children in extended family and with friends  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\* no maam  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\* USA, no breed bans  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\* 80f summer, 25g winter

\* when people ask us what kind of dog we want, we often say a cat-like dog . Now, obviously, there are differences (more active needs, attention needs, handholding for day-to-day requirements) but the more chill, the better.

I don't really want a harness because I've heard bad things about harnesses and dogs with fragile bones. Looking into Sleepypods, I noticed they didn't provide much information on the product and didn't show very many crash tests, or at least not as many as Pupsaver. Another brand I glanced at was Pupsaver, but I noticed the comments on their crash test videos were turned off. Also, I would be concerned about if it would work if the car somehow spins or turns during a collision, (or a side impact of some sort) I know nothing's going to keep him completely safe,  but I'm just looking for the best option.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kxtup/looking_for_dog_car_restraint_that_will_keep_him/

2023-10-31,1698715043,So frustrated with finding boarding.,"NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SOME CRAZY SPECIAL BOUTIQUE EXPERIENCE.

I know dog people want the best for their dogs. Im also a dog person, I have two of them and I would probably die for them. 

But boarding is getting out of hand. $50-$75 a day per animal, APPLICATIONS for boarding, required apps, full day temperament tests, required meetings with the owners, mandatory daycare/group play at boarding, packs, report cards, family suites, tuck in times, add on treat packages, tvs in the suites, the list goes on and on. 

Its impossible to find basic boarding. Im not saying the above boarding isnt great for some people, but I have COVID dogs. They dont really want to spend all day playing. One of them I know wouldnt pass the play group temperament test because hes an incredibly anxious dog. When hes boarded, he just lays curled up in the back of his area. I just need someone to keep them eating and drinking and pottying and on their medication schedule, not a damn daycare that has as many requirements as a childrens private school.

2023-10-31,1698715259,Help me expand my family,"Slightly long story: in 2010, I adopted a designer dog  a 15 lb cavapoo. He was abused and neglected by his original owner. As a result, he has separation anxiety and is extremely attached to me and my ex-husband. He is very smart. He doesnt like other dogs  in the past 13 years, Ive seen him play with exactly two other dogs. At the dog park, he sits on the bench with the humans. He isnt aggressive, though he does bark at other dogs. But when the other dogs try to sniff him, he runs away (usually behind my legs). He is currently 16 years old, and he needs special food for his kidneys. Hes still a sweet boy, but hes much sleepier than he used to be. My ex and I split custody, three months on, three months off, which seems to work for everyone. 

Now things get sad: My father recently passed on. My mother is not a dog person. She wants to get rid of his dog, an actual mutt. Hes three and weighs 40 lbs. He is dumb as a box of rocks, but he is sweet, and I feel strongly that we should keep my fathers dog within the family. So my mother wants me to take him. Nothing would make me happier.

2023-10-31,1698717734,Please help me choose the right breed,"Finally figured out the copy/paste on my phone.

  Introduction

1.	`Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Not our first dog. I grew up with dogs my whole life. We had GSDs when I was in middle and high school. I had my own GSD in high school. My wife and I had a Yorkie for 14 years.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I think I would prefer a breeder, though Im not opposed to rescue. I do want a puppy, and I have some reservations that a rescue puppy may have issues from abuse or neglect. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Great with kids. Active and playful but also content to be a couch potato. Ideally big enough to provide some protection/warning/deterrence for the family/house against those it doesnt know, but not threatening to neighbors or kids. We got used to Yorkie size but Ive had big dogs before, so kind of open. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We really dont want a dog that sheds but something a bit bigger than our old Yorkie, I think. Ive considered poodle (standard and Moyen), Airedale, Schnauzers, but am open to others Im missing. Also considered the doodle craze but am not convinced on that.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walk on a leash, fetch maybe, sit, lay on a dog bed, etc. (all the basics). Maybe he could go for a run occasionally. Ideally he could be in the front yard off the leash and not take off running. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

Care Commitments

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work from home and can work with the dog intermittently. Can commit to distance walking 4-5 times a week. The kids will frequently want to play/wrestle/fetch/tug of war etc. mental stimulation like teaching tricks or playing games I can commit to daily. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

See above. Back yard is fenced and fairly large. Fetch, walking, running some, etc.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We dont want shedding, and our yorkie got regular baths at home but would be shaved by the groomer maybe quarterly? Our kids keep us pretty busy. We trimmed his eyes and such between haircuts. 

Personal Preferences

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

Medium to large, ideally

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I dont want shedding. Would prefer not slobbering either. I dont particularly want a yippy dog, but we just had a yorkie. Funny enough he never learned how to fully bark. His bark sounded like a cough his whole life, which muffled the impact of his yippy barking.

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

In a perfect world, I could sit in the front yard with the dog by my side while the kids play in the cul de sac and not have to worry about him taking off. I realize this requires training - potentially a lot of it. Im not opposed to using a leash in such scenarios.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A little of both. I dont want it needing to be on me all the time, but the kids and my wife are probably OK cuddling with it.

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Easier to train and happy to please probably works best in our current lifestyle, but Im not terribly opposed to an independent dog. We did just have a terrier. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Watch and maybe a warning bark if it thinks something is unusual. If we let visitors in, Id like the dog to read the situation enough to be friendly to them recognizing were being friendly.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not really. Some conflict between dogs is expected but with kids all around I dont want to deal with this.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing really comes to mind. Ideally not a runner if the front door opens and it can take off. Chasing dogs through the neighborhood is a hassle we had to do with the Yorkie from time to time.

Lifestyle

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

There will be times but not usually more than a few hours. We both work from home. Vacations he would either go to a kennel or have a neighbor come take care of him, and in those situations would be alone longer.

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Sprinkled above. Ill be doing most of the care. My wife will help. Kids will play with it.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

None currently. Im sure my wife wants a cat but Ive never been an inside cat person.

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes - very much.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No we own our home.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Austin, TX - not aware of any prohibited breeds but anything that would make such a list probably need not apply for our situation.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

2023-10-31,1698729330,Why are my dogs paws so rough?,"So when I adopted my dog (1 year old husky/pit/GSD/chow mix) a couple months ago, both me and my friend noticed that his paws were super soft. Over time however his paws have gotten rougher and they kind of scratch my skin if he steps on me or paws at me for pets lol. I dont know what surfaces he was spending most of his time on at the rescue, but my apartment has a hardwood floor, and the areas we walk on outside are usually just sidewalk/pavement and grass/dirt. I dont think this is too different from what he was walking on before, because I know the rescue he was staying at walks their dogs on the sidewalk areas outside, and before that he was a stray. 

Anyways this isnt a huge concern for me but more of a curiosity. It doesnt seem to bother him at all and his paws dont seem to be painful or uncomfortable, just a bit dry.

The first 3 days she was afraid of me and wouldn't let me touch her at all without yelping like she was in pain. After 3 days though, she finally let me touch her and now we're very comfortable with each other. The issue is that with my parents she is still scared to do anything with them: sitting next to them, will not feed from their hands, definitely not allowing them to touch her at all too. 

She is comfortable enough at the house and has her little routine when I'm there, but if I leave the house, she starts pooping and peeing on the beds and mats without using the doggy door that I know she's capable of using. Because she's deathly afraid of being touched by anyone else but me, my Mom can't bring her on walks at all. She can't even put the leash on her, and if I put the leash on her, she refuses to walk with my Mom alone (though she has no issues if my Mom and I walk her together).

2023-10-31,1698772948,My dog has really long quicks and I need a solution,"Yesterday I spent the day in the ER with my toddler. I thought that my dog bit her in the forehead but it turned out that he got her with one of his claws. It was a freak accident and I should have been more vigilant with those two, but I've entirely changed my approach so these things are less likely to happen.

Anyway, I get my dogs nails trimmed regularly but they can never get them very short because he has really long quicks.

I've read that you can shorten them over time by trimming often but I'm not seeing this type of result. Actually it almost seems as if his quicks are getting even longer over time. Aside from regular nail trimming he gets plenty of walks on asphalt which I guess is supposed to help keep them filed.

When I was looking into my options I read that there are some vets who offer anesthetized quicking, where they use a laser and intentionally cut the quicks way back and then send the pup home with pain meds for a few days.

I've never cut my dog's quick, even on accident but I know this can be painful. As I'm considering my options I'm wondering if having him quicked intentionally would be unnecessarily cruel.

If you've ever cut your dog's quick, was it painful for them for a long time afterwards? Is this something they recover from quickly?

I obviously don't want my dog to suffer unnecessarily, but his claws are always so long they are on the floor when he's walking. I know this can't be good for him. And I also don't want to be in a situation again where my toddler needs stitches. 

I'm keeping the dog and the little one separate like I should have been doing all along. But this whole situation has got me wondering if there is a way to shorten my pup's quicks without hurting him too much or for too long?

2023-10-31,1698768257,What can help a healthy dog to prepare for the mouring of her partner?,"I have two dogs, G (9yo) and K(8yo). I have had G since she was 2\~3 days old. She was abandoned in the street with 4 siblings. They didn't have a mother to nurse them and they were all born with the thick disease (in my country we call it Babesia). Only G survived all of the 4.

When G was 1 year old we adopted K, she was 4 months old and lived in a shelter with 40 other dogs. K is extremely healthy and hasn't needed a vet in 7 years. Everytime we take her to do some blood test it all comes back healthy. She is fit, eats well, runs, all things.

G is the opposite. She was born sick, had liver problems and 18 months ago we removed a very rare cancer from her leg. It hasn't come back, but she has small begign tumor around her body and we recently found a medium one on her stomach. So far we haven't gotten to the part where G is suffering yet, but we know that day is coming in a year or two, 3 if we're lucky.

K can probably live another 8 years given how healthy she is, but the amount of health she has matches how dependent on G she is. K is only comfortable where G is. When we take G to the vet, we need to take K as well otherwise she cries until G is back. Once G was sick and we didn't send her to daycare, we only sent K. The folks at the daycare said that K didn't eat, didn't sleep and didn't play with anyone and was only thinking about G the whole time. Whenever I take K on a walk without G, she isn't comfortable and she's mostly just ""accompanying me until we get back home to G"". 

I'm afraid that K might give up on life when G reaches the end of her life and I was wondering if there's anything I can start preparing in advance.

dogadvice

Hello, about 3 months ago I took a puppy from a rescue. The add said she was very sweet and gentle. They even told us she should only get to be about 25 pounds- which is a lie as she is already 25 pounds at only 6 months and still growing.



I am having a very hard time handeling this dog.

When we first got her she was very calm and quite. She didnt play like you would expect a puppy to. She didnt even make a sound- just spent most if her time laying down with her head under a table or the couch.  I figured she was just sad from veing sepersted from all the other puppies.

The rescue had taken her to the vet before we got her- and I also took her. There was no reason for concern.


Within about 2 days I had taugjt her how to sit and things were going well-



Eventually my mom told me I shouldnt get to be the one to make all the decicions with her, and distrupted my training.


While I was teaching her ""Wait"" my mom started to teach her ""Stay.""


While I would give the puppy a toy when she bit me, my mom would tell me  to ignore her. As the dog got bigger she didnt stop biting.


I started to try ignoring her when she bit, but it disnt work. If i moved away she would just follow me- or get angry.


It got to the point qhere we would restrain her- gently making her sit and holding the bottom og her jaw shut. But my brother would hild and push her mouth closed seemingly rough. I told him to stop but he didnt.


My dog is now 6 months old. She still bites- for various differnt reasons.


She always wants to play but I dont like to play with her because it alwahs results in her biting me or getting angry. Very angry with a wrinkled nose.



Recently she has started to attack me completly unprovoked.


I would just be sitting on the couch and she would come iver and start to bite me.


She runs and hopes around- almost like zoomoes but with high pitched barks and she throws herself at me like shes trying  to knock me over.


Im not sure what to do or hoe to handle her any more.


My mom said we should give her away because she bit my brother in the face-- but I truely belive that was his fault as he can be rough with her at times. 

((Hes a child and needs to be taught---)) 

The other thing is that she has seperatipn anxiety and freaks out if we leave. Ive been trying to worl on this by stepping out for a moment then back in. The door is very scratched up.



She is friendly and excited to see us in yhe moring but throughout the day she is nightmarish. 


I have cuts and bruises all over my legs-- the longest being 4 inches but not deep.



She never draws blood when she bites bjt bites hard or in semsitive areas- 

Can this be fixed??",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kmj0f/biting_dog/

Strongly prefer an intelligent breed that is eager to please (i.e. pastoral or hunting breeds)

Prefer less shedding

Prefer less grooming

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I have owned multiple dogs all my life. I have a very strong preference for the eager to please-ness and handler focus of a pastoral or gun dog. Ive had other dogs and they just dont fit with my personality. Of course I am open to compromise, since finding the very perfect breed for my situation doesnt seem possible. (hence why Im here asking!)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Border collie without the intense need for constant stimulation at home. Or a Golden Retriever in a smaller package. Basically a smart dog, eager to please, up for a run, hike, beach trip, fetch, games, training, long walks, etc. but not in need of CONSTANT mental stimulation and attention at home (note: we will of course train and play and stimulate them at home. I just mean we also want to be able to watch TV in the evening or have a lazy Sunday afternoon without the dog looking to us for mental stimulation every waking hour).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\- Border Collie (ruled out because needs too much attention constantly).

\- Brittany (Same problem as above)

\- Mini poodles and smooth collies (both not bred here in my EU country, and collies are a bit too big anyway. Standard poodles too big, toys too small

)

\- Toller (I could maybe find one from another country and pay a lot to get it here, but I suspect they fall into the same category as the BC and Brittany?)

\- Cant get springer spaniels here

\- English cocker spaniels are common and seem to fit the bill... Are they more calm at home than BCs and Brittanys? 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Be active but able to switch off at home. Be handler focused. Play fetch.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Not including physical exercise outside the house? We work from home so would be able to interact in short sessions off and on all day and would almost always be there for companionship. But obviously we do actually need to work 8 hours each, so the dog needs to be able to settle while with us.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

1-2 hours a day. Im a runner, hiker, cycler, outdoors kind of person. We have dog parks nearby I would probably use at weekends. Also longer hikes/walks/trips at weekends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Its not something I want (who does?) but Im more willing to compromise on this than other factors. If its perfect in every other way, I can handle regular grooming and/or regular visits to a pro. Groomer.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

No bigger than 20kg (45lbs)! Ideally would be in the 10-15kg (20-35lbs) range. We could go a bit smaller but with 2 young kids that would start getting to a size where its less ideal for the dog.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

As little as possible but again, something that can be compromised on if necessary.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not essential but I would really really like to be able to do this

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Greet friendly

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Few hours here and there. Mostly people will be at home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Same as mine

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Europe. Some less common breeds are unavailable here.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Mediterranean climate. Hot summers, mild winters",dogs,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kkkxo/active_but_calm_intelligent_family_dog_under_20kg/
2023-10-31,1698757198,Good harness for a German Shepherd who's hard to control during walks?,"My wife and I have two German Shepherd's. Both are about nine and a half years old. They've only lived with me for just over a month (as we flew them over to the UK with us from American, where my wife used to live), but she's owned them since they were puppies. The female is a joy to take out for walks. She just wants to be everyone's friend. The male however, is a very dominant boy who will attack other dogs if not held back.

I wasn't happy with the male's behaviour on a lead, so my wife bought a pinch collar (I didn't like the idea of the pinch collar at first, but she talked me round to the idea of it). He became a bit easier to control while using this collar, but still barked at dogs. Well, today he pulled hard on the lead to get to another dog, and the pinch collar popped off of him. It took a minute and a random stranger holding the female dog for me to get him under control, but by that time he'd already terrified the other dog and its elderly owner. I felt so embarrassed and quite shaken by the whole ordeal.

A pinch collar didn't work and my wife has said a slip collar is out of the question,  so I'm now looking for a harness to attempt to get better control over him. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good harness for a German Shepherd?",dogs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kkgzn/good_harness_for_a_german_shepherd_whos_hard_to/

2023-10-31,1698724862,[Misc Help] Sketchy rescue won't give me ownership of the microchip.,"They also never gave me the dog's rabies or sterility certificate. I had to do puppy shots over again at my vet, and go straight to the vet office she was spayed at to get the rabies certificate.

I'm very concerned about her information going back to them and am afraid if anything terrible happened and she was found without my collar on that they would take her back because I'm a ""bad owner"".

Is there anything I can do without getting them involved to take ownership of it?

UPDATE: Petlink let's you do it by uploading vet records, adoption papers, city license or rabies certificate. As long as it has your name it should work... Still waiting for verification.

UPDATE 2: Been a few days and I got confirmation that they have received the request yesterday. They do alert the current owner of the chip registration to give them an opportunity to contest it. My hope is that the email is lost in their inbox or they think nothing of it, just another chip alert about something not important. Fingers crossed.

UPDATE 3: I've been denied!

UPDATE 4: I guess rejected means accepted to them because I responded asking why it was denied and the chip company told me I am already registered as the owner. Very organized operation there.",dogs,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kcgrz/misc_help_sketchy_rescue_wont_give_me_ownership/

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* Yes, as primary owner. However, we had a Labrador retriever when I grew up.  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* A breeder.  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* Intelligent, trainable, can come with me on hikes and into the wild. Will at least be able to warn me of dangers. Can tolerate my two kids, and can be happy staying with my mother  when I need to be away. I want to be active with my dog, and I want to train my dog. Id prefer a dog that wont destroy our house, and wont shed too much. But, its not a dealbreaker. I want a companion, someone that I can love, and who will love me, and to be with me every day for the next decade or so.  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* All medium to large sized dogs are of interest. Ive been looking at Labrador Retriever, German Pointer, Rhoedisan Ridgeback, Belgian Tervuren but I am open for anything.  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* General training. No specific sport or activity. Obedience.   
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* We wont be competing. I want to train my dog in general as a hobby. There is a brukshundklubb, like working dog club thing next to where I live where I would like to take courses and train, maybe twice a week. Rest of training will be in the yard or in our forrest.  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* I want them to be part of my life most of the day. I currently walk about 2.5h per day during weekdays (1.5 hour in the morning and 1h in the evening). I want a companion for those longer walks, but also looking forward to more shorter walks throughout the day. On top of that, I would spend one or two evenings at the dog training club doing courses, and I would probably spent some hours here and there throughout the week doing training. I hope my kids would also like to do some training. We have plenty of fields and we live net to the woods, and our family spend a lot of time outdoors.   
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* No running, but I walk about 2 to 2.5h per day. That would be the bulk of the exercise. Maybe my fiancée could take the dog for runs as well, but that woud be sporadic. Walks, long and short, would be the bulk of it.   
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* Id prefer net too much grooming. But its not a deal-breaker. I would of course do what would be needed.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* Medium to large dog.  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* Id prefer less, for all of those things, but I can handle it. Not dealbreaker.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* It would be important for me. When I am out in the forrest, I want to have been training my dog to a level where we can comfortably hike without a leash without having to worry about the dog going totally crazy if we run into deer or similar.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* I would love a snuggly dog.   
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\* Eager to please would be good. But also not a deal breaker.   
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* Here I am not sure. I sleep lightly, because sometimes I am worried. Sometimes I need to sleep alone in the house. I want the dog to a least wake up and warn me if there is something going on. But, at the same time I would like the dog, when I am with it, to be able to greet strangers. I guess I am looking for something in the middle.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* No.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\* Nothing that I can think of.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* Not long. I cannot think of situations where it would be left alone. Some minutes here and there.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My wife, and my two sons would be involved with the dog somewhat. Maybe take it for walks and do some playing with it. But I would be the one spending most of the time with the dog (during the days etc.)  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* No other pets, no other pets planned.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* Yes. By sons are currently 4 and 6.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\* I live in Sweden, out of the big cities.   
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\* Winters are cold, and summers are usually pretty hot. Temperate environment.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

2023-10-31,1698743834,Letting go of my best friend and soulmate,"We put our family dog down yesterday and it feels like Ive lost a part of myself and my soul. I loved her like Ive loved nothing before and it feels like Ive failed her. We went to the vet yesterday since shes been on antibiotics due to a pneumonia, sadly she had gotten another infection in her uterus. Our vet told us that our beloved family member was fighting right now and that she hadnt fully recovered but sounded a bit better (she was breathing fast and heavily). For the last couple of days she stopped eating, couldnt sleep so she sat up, mostly being exhausted, trouble going to the toilet and wasnt herself. It was hard seeing her that way. Sometimes she would be more herself by barking and wanting cuddles. Our vet said we could undergo a procedure to remove her infected uterus but wasnt sure she would make it due to her pneumonia. We didnt really know what to do. She was 10 years old and the thought about her undergoing this operation and not making it felt horrible, we didnt want her last hours being scared, alone and with her fighting to recover and staying alive. She would need intensive care. When she went to sleep my father held her closely and petted her, I couldnt be in the room which I also feel awful about.

We decided to let her go. Now I cant get over the thought that maybe she couldve made it if we just gave her a chance. I dont know what to do with all this guilt. Everything happened so quickly and it feels unreal, it feels like we gave up too fast and failing her by letting her go. I have so much guilt over not giving her more in life, of not doing more for her when she was healthy. I havent lived at home for about two years but I constantly think about why I didnt go and see her more, why I didnt take her on long walks, why I didnt take her to see the world more.

2023-10-31,1698728616,Why do I make my dog anxious?,"I have a golden retriever, Ollie, who is 3 years old, and I have had him since he was 12 weeks old. He has always been a very submissive dog. For example, any time he goes to the dog park he immediately rolls on his back if a dog is even slightly aggressive. I have never been physical with him and to my knowledge nobody ever has since I got him. I honestly am afraid to even yell at him in the slightest if he does something wrong because I know how anxious he can get.

I don't understand why, but he gets very anxious if I get into his bubble. An example is, if he's ever laying down on the couch and I go and try to lay next to him to cuddle, his eyes get really wide and he tilts his head away from me and sometimes even rolls to his back a bit. And every time without fail, he will get up and move somewhere else to lay down. He doesn't do this with my wife though, and a lot of times seeks her out to cuddle.

Outside of this, him and I have a great bond and we play together all the time and he loves it. Is there any explanation as to why he acts this way towards me? My other dog is absolutely obsessed with me and will snuggle me whenever I want and has no anxiety towards me. Is there anything I can do to help him build confidence around me and maybe get him to learn to like snuggling with me like he does my wife?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kdgxk/why_do_i_make_my_dog_anxious/
2023-10-31,1698724370,Anyone else have a hand reared puppy with behavior problems?,"My dog, Fred (3M/French bulldog), was born with a cleft palate. Somehow the breeder didnt notice the cleft, and he was spared euthanasia (cue his villain origin story) and surrendered to a rescue the day after the was born. 

Cleft puppies cannot nurse, so they have to be raised fully by hand, which is not easy. The rescue was able to keep him physically healthy and he came to us as a foster (then eventually adoptee) when he started eating dog food at around 7 weeks.

He has some pretty severe behavioral issues, primarily neuroticism/aggression. Curious if anyone else has a hand reared puppy and what their behavior is like.

Some details about Fred:

"" Issues started around 9 months to a year old

"" Neurotic/obsessed with tennis balls 

"" Food/food bowl aggression 

"" Very smart/food motivated - knows about 20 tricks (we emphasize tricks due to the behavior issues)

"" General brattiness, for lack of a better word (refusing to do things), and aggression if you try to force him

"" Generally gets along fine with our other dogs, most of his issues are with me and not my husband 

"" Must follow a strict routine every day or he gets testy

"" Physically healthy

They've gotten into a couple fights, the second one costing me almost $700 to treat his puncture wound, but more importantly, the emotional distress of him being hurt, for me and for him. 

From what I understand,  since I was not present at either situation, is that the Pyrenees mix is not ""reading the room"" and barges into other dogs' space. Furthermore, he does not understand corrections as such, and escalates instead of taking the correction. 

I'm not sure if it's my dog's fault, or the other's. But either way, my dog is almost 1/2 the size of the other, and I'm worried that the next fight could be the last. Yes, we can limit their interactions or even keep them apart permanently, muzzle them, etc. That is not a solution I had hoped for, because that limits their socialization opportunities. And this other dog belongs to a family member who I am very close with. Ideally, I want all the dogs to get along, or at least, be ambivalent towards each other.

2023-10-31,1698712332,Help older dog to lose weight.,"Hi all!   
I am looking for suggestions to help my rottie get in shape. I  don't really know if hes obese or pudgy or the right weight? He's just definitely not athletic. Hes a male and about 125lbs  
He's five years old (halfway through the life expectancy of a rottweiler). He doesn't show signs of joint pain, but I don't want to set him up for failure in the future.  
He walks about a mile per day, and I have recently introduced him to swimming. Easy on joints, but he has short stamina. He gets walked at night because we live in the south and he has a double black coat, so he gets super hot. winter is definitely easier on him!  
The vet told us to feed him 6 cups of food a day, but 4 seems to satisfy him.

2023-10-31,1698711055,11-Week Old Pup Awake 9-10 hours a day -- What?,"I have adopted a wonderful little ""Mi-Ki"" pup (a toy breed) who weighs about 2.5 lbs at 11 weeks old. He is very smart and will be trained as a medical alert dog. What's weird is, despite the entire Internet preaching that pups this age are only awake 4-6 hours a day... He is awake 9-10 hours a day. He's in full puppy mode, so very high maintenance when awake. I'm having trouble getting him to sleep in the middle of the night because he seems to be most Zoomie then sometimes. 

These dogs all struggle with hypglycemia, and we have had two episodes--but caught the second one much faster, and are getting the hang of it. Basically, I know now that he needs to eat a lot, all the time. Could this be part of what's going on with sleep, though? Does hypoglycemia affect sleep?

I have only had him a week and a half. Has anyone else had this issue, with a new adoption being wide awake way longer than anticipated? Did it even out with time, or is your dog just awake a lot more than other dogs?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17k7w2r/11week_old_pup_awake_910_hours_a_day_what/
2023-10-31,1698710880,My girl took the rainbow bridge today &amp; im devastated.,"Our girl was 5 years old, turning 6 in February &amp; was diagnosed with Lymphoma in August. Being as we just had a daughter 9 months ago &amp; couldnt afford chemo, we opted for the prednisone route to keep her as comfortable as possible for as long as possible. She started to decline the last couple of weeks, so we took her in on Thurs &amp; the vet said she wouldnt chance going thru the weekend, in case things took a serious decline. But we upped her preds &amp; took the chance &amp; scheduled her euthanasia for this afternoon. 

Over the weekend we did all her favorite things. Went for as many walks as possible, played fetch, played in the leaves, watched the ducks &amp; all the treats. Then my wife &amp; I took today off to spend all morning with her, just us, as we dropped our daughter off at daycare. It was the best day. We went for a morning walk to the park, played fetch &amp; she had some cheeseburgers &amp; an ice cream cone for lunch. Then headed for the vet. 

Watching our girl get ripped away from us was truly heartbreaking. Nothing could have prepared me for that. I havent been able to stop crying since we got home, Im absolutely devastated. 

I guess the point of my post is just to vent &amp; also ask how some of you have coped losing a dog so young? She was a mixed breed &amp; was never sick a day in her life. We thought she was going to live forever (not literally but at least 10-12 yrs). I feel robbed of time with her. Im so sad that my daughter wont grow up with her as her puppy. Shes been with me &amp; my wife thru everything. Graduating college, moving across country, getting married, moving back, buying a house &amp; now the start of parenthood.

She was over here soaked and shivering so I let her in a few times to give her a break. Since she isn't my dog haven't treated her for ticks but she badly needs it badly needs a lot of stuff.

2023-11-03,1699021764,My dog's tags are randomly missing?,"A couple months ago, I accidentally hooked the leash to the tag ring instead of the leash ring on my dogs collar. 95% of the time, my dog, Kevin, does not pull on the leash, but this time we happened to walk out the door at the same time as our neighbor and their dogs. Kevin loves their dogs, who are adorable, but excitable and off leash all the time, so it was too much for Kevin and he ran after them, hit the end of the leash, and the ring failed and his tags went flying every which way.

We found all the tags and replaced the ring with a much sturdier one and have been careful since then not to hook the leash to it.

This morning, however, we noticed that the ring and tags are completely missing, and we're baffled. Not only do neither of us remember hooking the leash to tag ring, if he'd pulled the ring off while on a walk we definitely would have noticed. Not only would it have taken a lot of force, but once the ring fails, the leash isn't attached to the collar anymore!

He is never outside the house without one of us supervising, so no one else could have removed the tags. Even if someone had had the opportunity, why would they?

The only thing we can think of is that at some time inside the house, he caught the tags on something and pulled hard enough for the ring to fail. But he would have had to pull so hard, I'm having trouble believing it. Something like that should have made some kind of mess or ruckus. It seems like it also could easily have been very traumatising.

Hello =K 

our family has been on a trial adoption with beautiful greyhound Abbi for the last two weeks and love her very much. i think she is settling in very well, but some of the only problems are : she sheds HEAPS, and she has a lot of energy. 

like, we brush her for 10 minutes and get about five cups of hair come off (and there's still more!!!!). anywhere she sits in will have heaps of hair after two minutes. 

i have taken her out for two walks, one for 20 minutes and one for 40 everyday, but she still is very hyper and wanting more. no one in the family has the capacity to take her out for much longer, and the nearest off leash and fenced park is 20 + minutes away. we can only really fit that in on weekends. 

two of the main reasons we got a greyhound is because they don't shed much (and we were told abbi didn't at all) and that they are very chill

has anyone else had this happen? will it stop as she settles or can this happen the rest of her life? any advice would be amazing. 
 we really love her but two of our family are very allergic to dog fur, and we don't have the capacity to support her getting out for over two walks a day.

2023-11-03,1698981103,[Breeds] A good dog for daily walks in Seattle,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* No preference

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

\* Capable of being home most of the time with me in an apartment in a big city where it rains often while I'm working most of the day on the phone without barking or trying to jump on me constantly. Enjoys walks up to 30 minutes long throughout the day (I can do up to 4 a day 30 minutes each, spread throughout the day). Can get along with other dogs in elevators, walking down the street, etc. Highly prefer a dog that I can do a lot of training for; especially being off leash indoors. Doesn't need to be a guard dog or anything, not worried about having a pet to defend me or my home. Dog can't be any smaller than something like a Shiba Inu. I also don't want any pug, bulldog, Saint Bernard, etc head shaped dogs. I like athletic looking dogs like greyhounds, shepherds, huskies, etc.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* Greyhound sounds like a perfect fit for what I'm looking for. Lounge around most of the day, like short bursts unleashing their energy, big but not too heavy, look good, won't be as loud as other dogs, and not as much shedding with their coat. I like athletic looking dogs like greyhounds, shepherds, huskies, etc. Pharaoah hounds are my favorite looking dogs overall. I'd love a husky or wolf looking dog even though realistically they might not be the best fit.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Off leash and generally capable of being able to be independent and responsible so I can trust the dog to behave properly and enjoy their life instead of me having to feel the need to cage them up.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* None

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* I would be with the dog pretty much all of the time, but directly interacting with them (playing, walking, etc) I'd say around 2 hours a day at least.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* 2 hours mix of walking around a city, off leash walking indoors in a lounge area, and running around a dog park

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Daily whatever at home. I have my own daily skincare routine, etc. so it wouldn't be anything unfamiliar to me

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

\* Medium or large

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* Shedding is fine and minimal barking and slobber ideally

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Very important

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Open to either

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

\* Mix of both. I want the dog to be independent, but also loyal enough to respect my companionship so they listen to me.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* Dog should be indifferent or curious, but not threatened or hostile

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* As long as I can train it to not be aggressive to other dogs since I don't want a dog that is aggressive to other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

\* Generally don't want a dog that wants to play and meet everyone. I would prefer a more aloof dog.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* Borderline never. Only exceptions realistically would be if I have to go to an appointment and can't bring my dog. I work from home so the dog needs to give me space for most of the work day, but I can interact with them pretty regularly throughout the day and go for a walk every few hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* N/A

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

\* No plans currently

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* Rent and restrictions aren't really a factor atm

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Seattle and not aware

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* 40-70 degrees with light rain

A month ago I moved into student housing where there were already 3 roommates. One of the roommates is home quite often, her name is going to be A for this post.

When I got my dog, she never really liked cuddling in the bed with me. I didn't understand it, was a little hurt, but she was fine with cuddling on the floor, so I had that. When I moved into my new apartment, A really took to her and when I'm at work, my dog will go to A and sleep in her bed. A has no issue getting my dog on the bed with her, and to be totally frank, it hurts that she refuses to come to my bed. My dog is spending more and more time with A in her room. A is getting posessive, but that's another post.

I'm really upset over it, more than I thought. Are there any tricks I could use to get my dog to want to spend time with me in my bed?

2023-11-02,1698958666,Does your dog ever leap up and nose-dive/pounce down like a fox hunting in the snow? What is the purpose when not hunting?,"Sometimes, very rarely, my dog leaps up vertically into the air, tilts his body down and pounces head-first below with his paws out. The only thing I can compare it to is a [fox hunting in the snow](https://imgur.com/a/k4vjCeM). 

Ive never really see a dog do this so nimbly and fox-like before; normally his pounces are smaller and less dramatic. Im wondering if its common and what it triggers it. My dog very rarely ever does it, but he so far he has with the following:

1. Hunting insects in the grass
2. Nose-diving into the couch when playful
3. Playing with the cat

Obviously number 1 makes sense, but one time I saw him doing it repeatedly in the yard. At first I thought for sure he found a mouse or something, but then I noticed he was by the cat. He was pouncing around her like he was playing, but it looked like a hunting technique. 

He wasnt pouncing *on* her, just jumping up and landing beside her. He loves the cat and always gets playful, but thats the first time I saw him do that around her.

The puppy is really stubborn and bity, and I dont mean playfull bity but he really sometimes bites hard my girlfriend. Me he doesnt bite actually, I dont know if ita some powerbattle that he has with my girlfriend now? But my gf is really worried now because the puppy isnt really ""golden retriever like"" at all yet. He is really independent and for example really throws himself against the leash to the point where he is choking if we take him outside and dont move because he is pulling. He doesnt like to be cuddled and as said is really biting hard sometimes. We train him by stopping the play immediately as he bites. But yeah is this normal for these young puppies? Or is this individual just a bit more stubborn than usual and will turn out to be good boy with training and when he gets older. Just want to hear peoples experience and recommendations.

In the winter of 2020, my family fostered a dog and it was a positive experience. I now live alone in a small 500sqft apartment, I work from home, and I stay inside most of the time.

  
The one problem I see is that the lease states no dogs allowed. However, I have seen dog owners in my apartment complex, and my landlord has been nice and even recently lowered my rent upon request, so if I ask him about this I think I have a decent chance of him approving it. It's been a year since I've lived here and I've never met my landlord, so I might even get away by not mentioning anything. If he asks for a pet fee per month, it will be a tough decision.

2023-11-02,1698962777,This shit is hard.,"A disclaimer before I clear my mind; the love I have for my dog is nothing Ive ever experienced. I would probably jump in front of a car for her, Id drain my bank account for her, and half the time she gets better meals and sleep than me and her dad. 
My boyfriends dad rescued a heavily pregnant stray about a year ago. We ended up taking one of the pups. Shes a purebred American Staffy. A beautiful brindle girl. She quickly became the light of our lives.
I have always been a cat person. I grew up with Rotties, Dobermans, Basset Hounds. I absolutely love dogs. But my energy matches with cats 100% more than it does with energetic dogs. 
The first 3 months arent even the hardest. I could hold her in one hand and shed sleep on my lap while I did my makeup. Her pungent puppy breath spread all over my face while she kissed me was a highlight of my day.
Fast forward to about 7 months; things quickly became extremely stressful. I continued to tell my partner before we even got her, that we both work full-time, we are both working towards our career, and that we would need to sacrifice a lot of time for her. Her breed is naturally high energy. But I was not prepared for the multiple pairs of chewed shoes, the constant potty accidents, the frustration when she doesnt remember commands; the list goes on.
She recently got spayed, and having to constantly watch to make sure she isnt licking the wound, jumping around, or rough housing is so time consuming. My stress levels have been through the roof. Between working full time, starting a business, paying bills and just life in general, its actually really freakin hard. 
I dont have children, but I helped raise a set of premature twins. And I can say with confidence, I would rather have a baby than raise another puppy at this time in my life.
Im not looking for criticism, or even sympathy. I suppose I just wanted to clear my mind and find solace in knowing Im not the only cat-person but also dog-loving person who is quite overwhelmed with this whole thing. 
I also think its a good reminder that a puppy, or any aged dog for that matter, is a HUGE commitment. Be 100% ready, know for certain you have the support and resources to raise a dog the right way.

Now that it has been over 10 months, the idea of getting a new tiny member of our family started to come up& My parents thought about getting another podengo as they are amazing dogs, but I didnt want a dog that seemed too identical to Violet as she is special.

1 things id like to point out though:
-our dogs normally spend their life in the garden running around and playing& in the end of the day we let them stay with us inside the house by our sofa where they sleep for a bit untill we all go to bed and they return to the garden.

2023-11-02,1698957460,"Re-homing my dog, overseas.","Hi,

I have an American XL bully dog, 1 years of age. A true example to the breed - well structured, perfect temperament, and raised around young children. 

Never stepped a toe out of line, he is a true gentle giant!! 

Sadly due to the new fascicle law being implemented in the UK for the end of 2023 which generalises all XL bullys - not separating the cross breeds and poor owners from the thoroughbreds and tentative owners, I am left with no choice but to re-home my loveable boy overseas if possible. 

He is a Lilac Tri, fully vaccinated, microchipped and ABKC registered.

The reason for attempting to re-home him is because to me, it is morally incorrect to have to have him neutered and muzzle walked for the rest of his life with only being 1 and through no fault of his own - this just does not sit right with me!!!

He is beautiful and a true gentle giant who deserves the best which is what I have always gave him, he was bought as a family pet who will be greatly missed if we can re-home him overseas. 

Only loving homes, proof of the best home and fitting, sensible owners who are used to a large breed - as all this will be vetted. 

I do not know where else to post this, and it is almost a last ditch attempt to give him a loving home who can keep him in his natural state fully intact etc with no muzzle needed. 

He has never shown any aggression, plays really great with children never a problem. 

He is just over 60kg, Im great health &amp; condition all round - and a stunning boy to say the least!!

2023-11-02,1698947800,Stepping on toys nonstop!,"We love our puppers (7f - 60lbs, 1m - 40lbs) very much and want them to have happy and fulfilling lives. Weve gotten them a variety of toys (and replace them as needed, they are serious chewers), play with them every day, and they love to play with each other.

The problem: I am so tired of stepping on/kicking toys! The worst is the hard wood/antler type. Its like stepping on a Lego or stubbing your toe really hard. But the stuffies and balls get me too, startling me and throwing me off balance. Its gotten worse with the baby boy but even our senior girl occasionally leaves things lying in the walkways. (Because they are dogs, lol. This is not a behavioral problem, they dont know the difference and are very good dogs).

Is it cruel to them if we pick up most of the toys and only let them have like 2-3 at a time? What if we give them the hard ones during a specified chew time and otherwise they are put away out of reach?

Has anyone else had/solved this problem? I will do whatever is best for them, but I am hoping there is an option that is good for them and also saves my poor feet!",dogs,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17m9ff3/stepping_on_toys_nonstop/

2023-11-02,1698945010,Looking to get Rottweiler Puppy by Next Summer,"DISCLAIMER: If you disagree with a person purchasing from a breeder then please scroll. I just need recommendations not a lecture. I have adopted dogs from shelters before and probably will again later in life.

We got robbed once and it was because my dog saw someone coming but never barked because she got treats :/

I understand where we went wrong, and I am simply looking for a way to make it work.","Let me start by saying, ""Please don't bash my family"". I understand where we went wrong, and I am simply looking for a way to make it work.

In December 2021, my mom picked up my dog from the shelter at this mass adoption event. No research was done on the breed, but she thought my dog was a beagle. After taking her to the vet, we learned she was a Treeing Walker Coonhound. The past year has been really rough because everyone in my house is either working or in school full-time, so my dog spends most of her day at home alone. We have a huge fenced-in yard, and my dad works from home, so she does spend time outside daily. 

But when we come home, it is a yelling match; she barks uncontrollably in our faces until she falls asleep. The first year wasn't terrible as I think she was getting used to new people, but now it is out of control. 

I try to walk her when I come home from work, but by the time I get home, it's dark out. I feel so bad for her bc I know her barking is because she is bored. I have tried buying kongs, lick mats, and even dog puzzle things. She is an intelligent dog, and finished the puzzles in minutes. 

She does spend some time outside every day as we have a huge fenced-in yard. My dad works from home full time, so he does occasionally walk her during the day. On the weekends, when I am off, and on Fridays, I try to walk her for at least 2 miles. I also try to take her on errands with me just to give her a change of scenery. 

Additionally, the barking is taking a toll on my parent's marriage. My dad didn't want another dog (my labradoodle passed in the Spring of 2021), but my mom really wanted another one as her mother passed away in the same season. 

As the oldest daughter, I feel like it is my responsibility to rectify this issue before I move out next summer. It has honestly taken a toll on me hearing both of my parents complain about each other in regards to the dog. We are honestly stuck because we don't want to give her back or away because she has almost been with us for two years, but at the same time I also feel like we are doing her a disservice. 

 So again I ask for any advice, and to not bash my family bc I am really trying here.

Thank you in advance.

For the past 10 months he has been living with relatives because her living situation didn't allow her to have a dog. He's extremely depressed, refuses to eat, howls all night, and destroys things during the day if left unattended.

The relatives who took him in were kind to do so, but they didn't really take care of him. They have two other dogs, so he had friends to play with, but they let him eat whenever and however much he wanted (he has gained a lot of weight), let him sleep on their bed (not really an option now, since my sister has a twin size and he's huge), and so on. He misses those freedoms and misses his friends.

They are now discussing the possibility of her dog becoming the relative's dog because he is so unhappy with my sister now. This way she would at least be able to visit him and see him happy. This breaks my heart because he was such a lively and playful big guy a year ago.

2023-11-02,1698933840,Dog breed for small apartment?,"
Hi, I am a veterinary student who lives in a small apartment with my boyfriend fairly central in the city. We both love dogs and are thinking about getting one in maybe a year. The thing is I love dog training and have taught activities like agility and nose work to my family dog and would love a breed who I can work with. However Im afraid that such a breed might not work to well in a busy city and small apartment. We have looked a bit into rescue dogs and seen that some greyhound mixes might work good for apartment but might not be so easily trainable. My boyfriend is also allergic to cats but doesnt seem to be allergic to dogs. However a hypoallergenic dog or at least a dog that doesnt shed too much might be good.

So does anyone know a breed that might work for our situation? Highly trainable yet will be comfortable relaxing in a small apartment?

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first dog, have trained my family dog (Portuguese water dog) in basic obedience, agility, some nose work and rally obedience.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder].

* There are so many dogs who need homes so I would like to rescue, however my family dog is from a breeder so I am not opposed to that.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Highly trainable, medium energy, someone who can go all out in training yet relax when home. Ideally a medium to big dog. A dog who can be by themselves for maybe up to four hours at a time. Love a dog who is food or play motivated. Maybe not too loud or guarding because I dont want to disturb neighbors. Doesnt shed too much.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Greyhound because there are many rescues and I have read that they adapt well to apartments. Working dog like a doberman or herding dog like a collie because of the trainability however afraid they might not work to well in an apartment. We have also looked at poodles because they can excel I agility and are hypoallergenic.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Would love agility, however I am down for any activity that the dog love like maybe nose work, discus, obedience or fly ball. The important thing is that I can work with the dog in some way at least.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I would love to compete in for example agility and did that with my family dog on rookie level a couple of times until we found out she had arthritis.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Depends on the day but Id like to train basic obedience like heel, sit, stay, retrieve etc on every walk every day plus would like to train agility or something similar maybe once a week. So maybe altogether two hours a day? And obviously time to snuggle a couple of hours.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least one hour walk per day but probably 1,5 to two hours split up in three walks. I love playing and running around on the walks and will probably use a dogpark often because I live in the city, however there are rarely dogs using the park.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I will probably do the work myself and can do some work however I would like a dog who doesnt need daily work on their fur.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to giant.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not to much shedding because of my boyfriends allergies, moderate amount of barking is okay but not all the time because I live in an apartment. Slobber is not problem.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Fairly important, I would love to be able to do that but can use a long leash if that is not possible.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesnt matter too much, a dog who wants to be close but it doesnt matter too much how cuddly they are.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Doesnt matter too much, maybe not too friendly or too hostile.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, however I would like a dog who isnt too dog aggressive.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Not really, maybe people aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not too long or often, up to four hours at the time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My boyfriend, doesnt have too much of a preference just not too much shedding.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No however the dog would have to stay with my parents or his parents if we were going away. My parents have a medium size dog and his parents have a small dog and a cat so that would have to work.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, maybe rent in the future but no restriction that I know of.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Sweden, Uppsala which is a pretty big city. No bans however Sweden doesnt accept for example pit bull as a breed because they have been bred for fighting in the past however other similar dogs like American staffordshire terrier are accepted.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Can be up to 30 C in the summer and -10 C during winter.",dogs,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17m47fz/dog_breed_for_small_apartment/
2023-11-02,1698933362,Dog bit walker,"Hi there, looking for some advice and thoughts. We have a 16 month old aussie shepherd. He goes out with a dog walker a couple days a week and we walk him the rest. The dog walks are out in the countryside (on private land) but with some other dogs i.e not solo walks. 

He was out with the walker today and there was a new dog he was play fighting with. The play fighting evidently got out of hand and turned into a fight that the walker broke up. In the process of breaking it up, our dog bit the walker. Enough to draw a little blood but not enough to require stitches or anything. 

He's never bit any one before although we have had some issues where he wants to jump at the odd jogger or cyclist going past on our walks. This is normally when he's surprised and it's not what I would call aggressive i.e. it's a jump and bark but once the lead catches him, he losses interest and settles vs pulling more or snarling etc.

2023-11-02,1698916510,Teaching the leash. Please help. All the online articles do not work,"Hello kind souls, 

Can somone please help me teach my dog walk on a leash? Everything online that I read basically states 'wait for your dog to come to you and reward her'. This does not work because when my dog has got the leash on, she simply will not follow me, even when I take the treats out, she still wont follow me. She just looks scared like I'm punishing her. I am not pulling on the leash, I'm just holding it.

I tried to disentesise her to the lead but having her keep it on around the house (she doesn't seem to mind it after a few seconds, just goes about her day) but she just freezes the moment I pick it up. What can I do, any ideas? 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, she is a 9 month old rescue and has been with me for 4 weeks now. She had been in shelter almost from day one so I don't think she has got a negative association with the lead. She appears to have settled in well in my house and seems to trust me - almost too much as she just wants to follow me around everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please help, I'd really love to start taking her outside the house, but just can't do it until she gets it, we've been trying it for a week everyday and made zero progress. I would not panic if at least I saw tiny bit of progress, but there isn't any.... :((",dogs,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17lzf2e/teaching_the_leash_please_help_all_the_online/

However, I am struggling with a few things:

1. She loves my friend and boyfriend more than me and whenever they're around she refuses to even sit by me or cuddle with me.
2. She wants ALL the attention from my boyfriend - wakes him and sits on his chest, needs to be sitting on him all the time, needs to be between us when we cuddle, barks and loses her crap when we try to make love, or kiss or hug.
3. When I take her for walks, she wakes up the dead and wants to start fights with other dogs and let me tell ya, she is tiny... it has absolutely ruined walks and I HATE taking her for walks because she embaresses me with her behavior and does not listen. She also tries to wriggle out of her harness.
4. Gets salty when I don't give her fancy food, which she wants everyday. She drinks the soup and eats the meat from her meals but leaves the kibbles.

I do not have the funds to send her to private dog training, how do I handle this...I know she is a dog, but I am getting resentful.

I sacrifice so much for her... and yet somehow I am not enough for her nor am I doing enough for her and it grates me.

Currently I'm trying to leash/heel train her as well as work on her resource guarding.  She does really well with a treat lure in our backyard, if she wants to. She's easily distracted and doesn't care much for treats unless they're new or, even better, new from a different person. I call her new experience motivated cause she doesn't care about praise either. As soon as we get out to walking anywhere else (I don't own a car, I have to walk her to daycare), she is pulling. If I stop, she doesn't care and will decide its a great time to smell what's currently there. 

For resource guarding, I think I'm getting there. She doesn't like trades because nothing is worth giving up her food bowl (empty), or her favorite toys. I have been getting her used to my hand coming close and it being treats instead of me taking it. Problem is, she knows I will take away her bowl (it's a puzzle bowl so she doesn't inhale her food but its plastic and i don't want her chewing holes) or any ""new"" toys she finds (rocks, batteries, shoes, anything) and I cannot take it as her jaws are too strong now, nor convince her to give it to me.

She's a rescue from Texas (I'm currently in Oregon, US) and the DNA (I usually do just for fun) said 50% lab and 25/25 German shepard and belgian malinois. So, it seems her parents were purebreeds  but probably not by responsible breeder? She lived with mom and siblings and foster family until 3.5 months until I got her. I talked to foster mom about socialization they were doing and they said they had some grumpy dogs that she got along great with and her and small child and husband, but it didn't sound like she was being introduced to new people, dog's, or other experiences. Fortunately she does great with all dogs, even leaving them alone if they ask. She's good with new people but only if they acknowledge her and she also has no manners. New places is hard and moving water is super scary. 

A month and a half ago we moved to Oregon just she and I for college (my third year). We live in a tiny room and we have a small ""backyard"" with no fence so she has a rope tie up. We go to the park with a 40ft lead every day for an hour. She plays at home when I do homework outside supervised. I know she's getting enough exercise because she will sleep through the night and no destructive behaviors like chewing/biting. However she also will do those if she's too tired like a toddler tantrum so it's a fine balance. She gets stressed going to sleep so she chews (on a yak cheese) herself to sleep every night. She has 4 meals a day and constant access to water. I'm never gone more than 6 hours a day (that's pushing it) usually no more than 3 hours at a time. I have a four hour shift at work once a week at 5pm so she goes to daycare those days and I pick her up before leaving for work. We don't interact much with housemates cause she's still learning her manners and the elderly pug won't tell her no, just ignore her so she keeps trying to play with him. Also cat training, she wants to chase the cats. We do living room training every day for about 30 minutes and she gets a treat if the cats move and she doesn't do anything.

He has good manners, hits a button to go outside, is potty trained, is well socialized and I have been super impressed with his adaptability. We even have cats and he's been nothing but sweet to them, aside from wanting to play with them a little too much. 

Coming on 3 weeks ago now, we decided to address the fact that our eskimo dog plays too much with our cats. We want them all to live happy and unbothered lives, so we decided to adopt a 2nd dog from the same shelter we got the first, so that the first dog has a dog of his size to play with.

We left with a Sheppard mix whom they believe to be born in January or February. He isn't much smaller than the first dog (and still has growing to do) and he reminded us of our first dog while at the shelter. We brought him home and the dogs get along well play wise and there are benefits that the 2nd dog will follow my first dog when going potty outside, into a kennel at night, etc. 

Only the 2nd dog has made our life crazy and I feel like our 1st dog is regressing in progress? They run around my house like wild animals, I can't even keep a pillow on my couch, my first dog has started running away with the 2nd all around town...we built a fenced in area right next to our back door but he will trip me up or slip the collar and run around the entire town without listening when he used to listen and come immediately (hence no need for fence before)...the new dog is food protective so they fight over bones and, while fed separately, will still growl at me and the cats. I have reason to believe this 2nd dog went through something due to the food protection and the fact that if you even grab his collar he wails bloody murder even though you're not doing anything at all. 

It's just been very frustrating. We are working hard to be diligent with both of them and patient. New dog is learning nothing from me with my first dog around since all they do is run around and I've had to chase them around town 4 times in the last 3 days.

My boyfriend and I are both beginning to question whether this is the right 2nd dog or if we should've gotten a 2nd dog at all. Ideally I would've liked a younger puppy for my 1st dog to teach but my boyfriend thought this would be a good fit and we are all for rescuing animals. We are heartbroken at the idea of giving him back to the shelter as we are both emotional people and I'd never forgive myself but we aren't sure where to go from here.

At this point, when I get them back from running the town, they get disciplined and kenneled which makes me feel awful x2.

Any advice or direction on this would be fantastic. Are we awful people for thinking this? Can this see its way through? What's effective? Should we rehome the 2nd dog while he is still young?",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17lif8n/we_adopted_a_2nd_dog_and_now_we_need_advice/

I will ask her to go into another room, and she will stand in the doorway and stare at me. If she is not getting constant attention, she whines and cries while sitting on the floor next to me. Im at my wits end. She is constantly following me and is underfoot, crying and staring unless shes on my lap or getting some kind of physical attention.

2023-11-05,1699226818,I'm euthanizing my dog for behavior,"My 7.5 year old lab terrier mix that I've had since she was 6 months racked up a bite history of 10 people. Including one child and a level 4 bite on my neighbor. 

Since day one this Craigslist rehome was aggressive, less than 3 days into having her she bit my aunt. 

I got her as a 16yo teenager and did everything wrong. I did not know any better and was not equipped emotionally or financially to handle an aggressive dog. I tried my best with what I knew and what I did have but I knew this would be the end. She deserved better but I didn't know. 

2 years ago I brought home a poorly bred german shepherd puppy when my first dog was around 5.5 years old. I poured all of my adult money and resources into fixing my fearful reactive german shepherd because I knew he could be saved. He wasn't too far gone, he wasn't an imminent danger to himself, pets, and our community. I actually considered BE for my german shepherd well before my lab mix because at least my lab mix was able to get through the door outside with out a fight because of fear. 

My lab mix saved my german shepherd. I knew what the future could hold and I knew then I needed to act immediately before he was too far gone like she was. 

I want to say my lab mix was a result of poor genetics, her mother should have had a spay abort, shouldn't have been bred. And while all of those are true I know with out a doubt we unknowingly reinforced the aggression.

I tried every training method in the book for her and this went on for years. 

My reasoning for making the decision to BE might shock and disgust people but I know somewhere out there this will help someone feel less alone. 

I'm euthanizing my aggressive dog because my partner and I bought a house and have something to lose if we get sued. I have other animals that depend on me. If we lost the house we could lose everything and I need to protect them. 

I can't have a dog that resource guards. I can't have a dog aggressive dog. Her aggression isn't always predictable. I know what you're thinking. ""All dogs give signs"", I've studied canine behaviour, I've worked with dogs professionally, half of her bites had no known trigger. She bit my 5 year old cousin who wasn't even near her and there was no trigger. 

I can't have a dog who bites and then goes back for more instead of retreating. 

I can't manage this aggressive dog for another 3-7 years potentially. I don't want to live my life around an aggressive dog. I can't have people over, I can't hire a pet sitter, I can't board her, I can't be ill or on my deathbed because who will care for her? The behaviorist that I talked to about BE said that dogs like her WILL bite again and that he wouldn't even bother with medication. He told me the only options are life long managment, rehoming to a family member, or BE. The behaviorist said she was too far gone. 

I would have loved to rehome her, but there isn't exactly a line out the door wanting a senior mutt with aggression and a known bite history. It's a huge liability and it's not fair to pass her off to another person. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I would never give this dog to some poor unsuspecting people looking for a family companion. 

Bringing her to a shelter would be cruel, not only would it be a liability she would end up rotting in the most high stress environment just to be pit down alone and surrounded by strangers. 

This dog has so few good days they are non existent. She has good moment more like it. She can't be around people, she can't be around dogs, she can't be around anyone but us. She lives in solitary confinement suffering and a prisoner of her mind. This is no life for a dog. 

I'm doing this on my terms because if not her life will end with another bite and 10 day rabies quarantine with animal control in the most high stress environment imaginable and then be euthanized alone and scared. Maybe it won't be for 3 years, or 6. I'm shocked this scenario didn't play out already. 

My dog is getting to retire in a sense. She gets to live out her remaining days eating all her favorite treats and food, running around, going to her favorite spots, and getting all the love she will tolerate from us. 

My biggest regret? Not ending her suffering sooner. 

My last and purest act of love will be freeing her from her mind.

If anyone gets this far please cherish the time you have with your pets and make sure to seek help at the first sign of problems. Don't wait. 

It really isn't in how you raise them. Unfortunately you can't fix a dog with just love and good intentions.

I adopted my Boston rescue when he was 2.5 he was healthy as could be but they did mention some potential knee issues so to limit running as sometimes he would hop on it.

Approximately a year ago (when he was about 5) we had a freak accident and extruded a disc in his spine. We avoided surgery since the cord was just bruised not compressed. He was initially paralyzed in his R leg but with rehab made about a 90% recovery last May. We had basically resumed our same wild quality of life with some minor changes as the MRI did indicate he had another bad disc so he had confirmed IVDD.

About a month after graduating PT that disc went bad. He bounced back fast but his gait has been altered since. Now after an odd setback its highly suspected he has a partial CCL tear. They are going to try PRP and rest as its not unstable enough at this point to operate. This has been very stressful as his only care taker.

He turns six in a few months and I often struggle with him not being able to do many of the things he loves. We arent able to go to dog parks anymore or have play dates so he misses that and has become very dog reactive on leash again. I cant let him roam while at work because we cant risk injury. i cant let him sleep in bed anymore as he jumps off in the middle of the night and that could be potentially fatal now. We cant play fetch or hard with toys which was his favorite thing. I do hire a dog walker to spend an hour with him while Im at work but the price is steep but trying to to what I can.

Any tips for keeping him happy. Hes my best friend and I feel like I am failing him. Im his fourth home and he had a bad past before me. But hes only five so should on average have a decent amount of life left. I feel Im a good fit to help him as I work in healthcare myself. Hes your typically Boston that loves to go crazy and run and play and be on the go. He does have pretty significant separation anxiety.

What has helped for you guys for your aging dogs that body has kinda failed them? What can I do to keep him fulfilled and happy. Somethings I have considered is starting Prozac to help with his anxiety, and possibly trying to find a walk up entrance apartment as one current place has lots of steps that I have to carry him. Hes allowed to do 2x20 min walks but we used to go o hour long walks before all this in addition to playing and running.  Somedays I wonder if Im even cut out to do this at this point I just love him and want him to be happy.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ok04f/giving_my_dog_with_a_failing_body_a_good_life/

They are good friends and can play relaxed, but it often escalates. My question is what point do I step in and calm them down? Or do I let it play out? 

1. In the yard the black lab will chase down the chocolate lab and try to push her down, biting at the back of her neck or if he gets her on her back at her throat. He got on top of her today while she was on her back and they started loudly growling and biting each other. The black lab wouldn't disengage when I yelled at him so I physically removed him. The chocolate lab didn't yip amd immediately tried to play with the black lab while he was restrained.

2. Inside they play mostly pawing at each other, or the black lab trying to bite the chocolate lab. Today they got somewhat rough. It got rough enough the chocolate lab yipped, at which point I grabbed the black lab and pulled him away. The chocolate lab kept trying to play with him so I kept them separate while they calmed down.

So should I be intervening or let it play out?  The chocolate lab is a giant ball of joy that wants to play forever so she seems fine with the rough play for the most part, but I'm unsure if it's making bad habits with the black lab with other dogs.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ohg5v/at_what_point_should_i_step_in_rough_playing/

We have his crate in our bedroom with the door closed so he is unable to get out and destroy things around the house but he has scratched up the carpet and door.

We have tried short durations in the crate where we put him in for 5 mins at random times but that has not shown any improvement in him. We have tried giving him treats to get into the crate and then sitting there with him with the door open, he still will usually get anxious and then refuse the treats.

2023-11-05,1699200510,Toughest Stuffed Toys? (Not Kong or Tuffy),"Hi guys,

My boyfriend just adopted a pitbull/boxer mix who loves stuffies. She is full size, but still in her puppy stage, so she has razor sharp teeth and loves to chew. 

We started with normal stuffed toys, not too easy to rip but not crazy strong either, as the shelter told us shes good with the stuffed toys. I guess while she was there she would do gentle bites and cuddle with them in her kennel. Well, as soon as she got comfy, she was tearing through them. 
We tried Tuffy and Kong stuffed toys, but she will rip the edges and pull it apart at the weakest part of the toy (like an arm on the Crocodile toy or even the very edge of the Bone shaped toy from Tuffy ((i think))

She tears through every single one we have given her. Weve gone to PetSmart, Tractor Supply and random local pet stores trying to find something for her. We got her about 2 1/2 weeks ago and shes probably gone through almost $200 in toys. 

We dont want to give her bones, due to the fact I find so many mixed reviews about bones, whether its bad for their teeth or stomach, we just dont even want to go down that route. And honestly, by the way she chews on the stuffies, she would more than likely crack a tooth on a bone. 

She likes rubber toys, but only for about 30 seconds before her attention goes somewhere else, but when she has a stuffy, her focus is on that entirely.

Was just wondering if anyone knows of any stuffed toys that their dog hasnt ripped through in 15 minutes?

2023-11-05,1699153270,Breed suggestion for apartment dog,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No - grew up with dogs my entire childhood. Had a Pointer-Poodle mix, then a Labrador-Husky mix and two Canaan dogs, then a Viszla mix.

While this will be the first dog that is solely my responsibility, I have taken care of my mom's current Vizsla mix for a few months while she was traveling, and generally have been very involved in training and caring for our dogs.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Have had bad experience with rescue dogs - my mom's current Viszla mix came with very bad separation anxiety and aggression towards other dogs that we have simply not been able to fix.

Going to go with a reputable breeder this time, though I don't care much about lineage prestige as much as the parents being mild mannered and appropriate for my lifestyle.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Medium sized - not too small for a bit of roughhousing, but not too big to be a hassle when living in an apartment.

Living in a city apartment and not having a back yard, high energy is probably a bit much. I do work from home and am looking forwards to morning and afternoon walks, definitely about an hour a day at a minimum. Would take it on a long (2 hr) run on the weekends as well occasionally.

I've noticed that I get slightly allergic around dogs that shed a significant amount so ideally not a big shedder.

A tendency to bark a lot could also be a problem, as I live in an apartment.

Living in a city, a social dog that is well trained for recall and outdoor dining is a must. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I really love pointer breeds, having grown up with them. They are incredibly loving and fun to train. From looking into this online, sighthounds seem to be a good option as well. What I've looked at so far and my reservations are:

Vizsla, GSP, American/English Foxhounds, Red Coondogs - may require too much exercise to keep in the city with my lifestyle. Worried about recall when doing off-leash hours at the park, since these are hunting/hound dogs. Really love them otherwise tho.

Whippet - seems to be a good match in terms of energy, shedding, size, personality. The only reservations with these are that they seem a bit frail. I've read that they can be apprehensive at dog parks and city environments.

English/Welsh Springer Spaniel, Brittany - all seem like good fits size and energy wise, they're pretty cute. Not sure if they shed too much or not and how social &amp; trainable they tend to be.

Also open to any other suggestions.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Most important is:
- recall
- staying home alone without causing a mess (obviously within reason with respect to time)
- socializing with other dogs/not being aggressive towards them
- not barking too much or jumping on guests as they open the door
- not begging for food

Would be nice to have a dog that is generally amenable to more advanced training and communication.

A dog that is comfortable swimming/in water is also a plus.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Looking forward to investing time in properly training and communicating with the dog. I work from home so will generally be present and can do short training sessions/give attention throughout the day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least two walks a day, for a about an hour total minimum. More on the weekends.
Live right by a dog park that we'll probably go to a lot.
My partner would like to take the dog on her runs.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Not looking for anything too intense but once or twice a week of grooming the dog seems fine. Obviously willing to pay a profesional for related services.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium, or a larger small dog. Probably around 30-50 lbs and 17-25"" tall.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Trying to avoid a dog that sheds too much.
I live in an apartment so barking should be relatively minimal as well.
Not a fan of slobbery dogs.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Important - I live near a park that has off-leash hours and don't have a private back yard so this would be their primary source of exercise besides the fenced dog park.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Leaning towards snuggly. I love Vizslas who are obviously velcro dogs.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Somewhere in the middle? Looking to spend a good amount training the dog, but working from home it would also need to be able to spend time on its own when I'm around.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I've had dogs that jump at guests and that gets annoying very quick. Should be trained to wait for permission to greet the guests at the door or something like that. Other than that, they dog should be comfortable with guests and visitors (both humans, children, and dogs).

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

The main one is that they must obey recall - a dog that wanders off away and gets lost is a big nightmare.
Other than that, excessive barking, not being able to stay home alone, aggression towards other dogs, excessive anxiety, chewing furniture, must be house trained.
I feel like most of these are up to training them young, though.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Occasionally for an evening when meeting friends, but I work from home so will be there with the dog most of the time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My partner wants a dog too. She is active and wants an active friend to do active things with. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not really.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Rent, no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

New york city, not aware of laws banning breeds I've looked at.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers can be 70-90 degrees and winters can be 20-40 degrees, but its usually somewhere in the middle.",dogs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17o2txf/breed_suggestion_for_apartment_dog/

Anyways, my parents have an outdoor dog. The dog is loved and cared for, gets everything he needs, including social interactions, playtime and daily walks. But they insist on keeping him outdoor (he has free range access to the whole yard), because they grew up with outdoor dogs and 'they were all healthy and doing well"" (their words)

I couldn't convince them to move the dog inside so I looked for an alternative to keep him warm in the winter. That is how I found a wifi controlled heated floor you can insert in the doghouse. His doghouse in already insulated, but I really wanted to add something that can heat up the space. 

So, my question is, what temperatures should I go for? The floor is connected to an app and I can set what temperature the floor should heat.

Right now it's not that cold outside yet, around 10-15°C (50-60°F) in the day and 5-10°C (40-50°F) in the night. It will probably drop in the winter, it's usually under 10°C (50°C) in the winter, and sometimes can go under 0°C (30°F), especially in the night.

If it helps: The dog is small size - 8 kg / 18 pounds, and is fluffy with thick-ish coat. Mixed breed, probably has a bit of Pekingese in him.

I just found this subreddit and I am desperate for some help. My mom's dog broke my finger during a walk when she saw an animal on the side of the road, pulling me hard and dragging me with her. I had to get surgery. It was pretty traumatic, and I haven't been able to walk her since. My mom adopted her with my brother, so nearly all of the walking is my brother's responsibility but I want to leash-train her better so she can get on walks more frequently since she is a pretty energetic dog - and also because I value her dearly even though I wasn't involved in the adoption process. She deserves to be more active. My brother is also struggling to walk her since she pulls too hard.

I don't think she has ever gotten any training let alone leash-training, so I am not sure where to start. I have taught her some basic commands, but no matter what I do, I can't shake the anxiety that I might hurt myself badly if I go on a walk with her again.

2023-11-04,1699136642,Is it okay to move and separate our dogs?,"Is it okay to separate our dogs?

My partner and I got two dogs together. We got the first one (allie) as a 3 months old, raised her to be about a year old and then got the second one (ash) also as a 3 month old.

They lived together now for about 2 years and seem to love hate each other. If one of us moved with only one of the dogs, will that cause trauma? Here are a few of their behaviors:

Possibly bonded:
- when taking one for a walk the left behind one will cry/whine 
- play with each other well
- interact with each other first when let out of crates
- good to eat food in the same room
- lick each others faces/ears at times
- sleep in proximity of each other (also on same human bed)
- when we moved and ash arrived in the new place first she was distraught until Allie arrived

Possible reason they may not be bonded:
- dont like sharing toys (but try to take which ever they dont have, goes both ways)
- ash started to growl to defend her toys/treats
- playing is pretty one sided (Allie most of the time is dominating play) while ash seems weary at times
- when walked together they are visibly more anxious/hyper
- nervousness from ash when Allie approaches her sometimes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
  
Reputable breeder, we need a predictable temperament. Also shelters here are filled with lurchers and greyhounds, collies, terriers, bully mixes, spaniel crosses, so many larger doodles, and for some reason a shit ton of frenchies, none of which would really work for us.  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
We really want a dog that is similar to our pug because she fits in our lifestyle perfectly, but finding an actual, reputable breeder breeding healthy pugs that can do all of the things dogs love to do without risks to their health is like searching for a needle in a haystack, hence this post.

Our ideal dog is super cuddly, we love the little velcro shadows, ready for adventures but can take a chill day or two, happy-go-lucky, small and needs to travel well (both car and cabin in the plane), and ideally a bit less stubborn than our current girl but not a deal breaker. 

  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
We love our pug, so we thought ""why not just get another pug?"", but the breeder of our first isn't breeding anymore, and I think it would be so hard to find another breeder that prioritizes health above all else and can actually prove it. I don't even know where to start searching. We're in Europe though where there are various pushes for ""healthy pugs"", but I feel like it's so hard to find the ones who are actually reputable, and not just breeding random mixes to get ""rare"" colors under fancy names like ""retromops"" and the guise of longer snouts automatically means better with no regards to anything else.

Our prime next breed candidate is a Japanese Chin. Everything we read about them seems to fit in great, but I don't actually have any personal experience with the breed. They seem like they would match our pug's personality great and they seem healthier overall, but I'd love to hear from someone with more experience.

We also looked at Cavaliers King Charles Spaniels, they seem PERFECT in every way, but they are also so unhealthy as a breed that we might as well just get a pug in that case. Can we even find a reputably bred one, given how common heart issues are in the breed? They are also on our upper limit size wise.

We know of a very reputable Chihuahua breeder, but I've met so many Chis with anxiety and resource guarding issues that I'm wary.

Poodles and the bichon family are out, I tried hard but my partner just can't get over his dislike of their look. Also no terriers, we are not a terrier family.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
Basic obedience is expected is this house, but I believe every dog can be trained to know how to behave in society and learn some cute tricks on the side. We'd adjust to the dog's personality from there.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
Again we'd adjust to the dog but no grand plans to be agility champions or anything like that. Our pug for example LOVES scent work believe it or not. We'd be happy to try conformation shows again with the right dog, but not a deal breaker if it doesn't happen.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
I expect multiple smaller 5-10 minute training sessions per day, we'd adjust to the attention span of New Dog. Someone is working from home almost every day, so it's easy to fit in. We do at least some puzzle toys or treat hide-and-seek daily with our pug as well, and when she's in the mood we fit in some tug and general roughhousing too. A lot of cuddles to be expected, as well as grooming sessions to bond.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
Our pug gets about an hour of sniffy walks a day, usually a portion of it off leash, and usually more on the weekends because we have everything from beaches to mountains within a 30 minute drive. If the weather is super shit our pug is happy to do only 30 minutes though, as long as we don't chain multiple days in a row. We tried doing more with our pug but she disliked the flirt pole and doesn't care about fetch, but we're happy to bring any of these back for New Dog. No dog parks near us, and I don't like them anyway.  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
We can do both, as much as the dog needs. We're used to nail dremels, cleaning ears and nose folds, baths, clipping of butt feathering, brushing.   
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
Small, needs to be airplane cabin size friendly because we live in Ireland and planes are the only efficient way to reach the mainland, and as expats we plan to spend at least a month each summer back home and don't want to leave the pups behind.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
We have a pug, shedding is our life, a robot vacuum exists for a reason. Barking would ideally be on the lower side, we live in a city after all. No slobber.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
Would be preferred where there is no traffic or livestock once proper recall is trained, but not a deal breaker.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
Give me all the snuggles, this is probably the biggest priority for us, we demand a cuddly dog.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
I love me a dog that wants to learn, but isn't too smart for their own good. Our pug is so smart and stubborn that she really tested all I knew about dog training before because she is really hard to motivate properly, so I'd prefer a dog that's a bit more eager-to-please if possible, but definitely no need for a high achiever that always needs a job.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
We have people over often, alert barks are fine but we want friendly dogs.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
No, hard deal breaker, we don't want to risk our current dog, and we live in a city where there are dogs everywhere and they need to be able to coexist peacefully in public.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
We're just looking for another chill, happy-go-lucky pup, so we are trying to avoid breeds prone to anxiety overall. We'd also prefer a dog with a natural off switch, our mudi foster didn't have one and as rewarding as raising her until she was ready to go to her forever home was, she was definitely all the proof we needed that we prefer a dog that isn't always in GO GO GO mode.   
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
As an adult probably 6 hours max once or twice a week when we both need to go to the office or go out somewhere we can't take the dogs, hybrid working means usually someone is home most of the time.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
My partner and I equally share dog caring duties, although I'm usually the primary puppy trainer.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
A senior, spayed pug. No other animals, no plans to get any.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
Not right away, but we and all of our friends of prime children having age so probably yes in the future.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
No restrictions, we are in the process of buying a house so no puppy until that is done.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
Dublin, Ireland. There are restrictions on some breeds like pit bulls, but no bans (yet).  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
Mild summers, usually not hotter than 25 degrees Celsius, mild but windy and damp winters, usually not colder than 5 degrees Celsius at the worst.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
We're mainly interested in what you all think of our breed list, and if there are any breeds we've missed to consider. We're at the right time to start researching breeders and getting on a waiting list with the goal to get this puppy in a year or two.

2023-11-04,1699136880,Re-Homing,"Ive come to the decision that my dog deserves better than what I can give her. Shes a chocolate lab/Border collie mix and she lives with my husband and I in our tiny apartment. In hindsight I shouldnt have gotten her because the home she was in before she had a farm to live on and roam around(we got her as a puppy, unfortunately from a mill) 
My selfishness of wanting a dog got in the way of her(the dog) needs and health. 
Shes up to date on her shots, shes CGC trained, extremely friendly and smart. So Ive no doubt we can find her a better home. 
Well my husband and I had a baby and I just cant take care of her (the dog) like I used too. It doesnt help that I broke my foot a while back. I used to run with her nearly everyday and with a broken food and child its nearly impossible to meet the dogs needs. 
Please excuse my poor pet ownership behavior for the moment and help me help my husband understand that the dog NEEDS a better home with a yard and people who can actively take care of her. He isnt much help either as he works 60-70 hour weeks and is exhausted when he comes home.

2023-11-04,1699122397,My dog is an escape artist,"My dog gave me quite the scare today, ill try not to ramble too much but ill add a TLDR at the bottom. Anyway, we (my husband, son, and dogs) have been living on my dads property in a camper for about a month now while we are in between houses waiting for our house to sell so we can buy the house next to my dad. Well the camper we are staying in has a chainlink fence around it that i can let my dogs run around in throughout the day. My dad is highly against dogs in his house (which we respect) but we dont want to stay in the camper all day everyday so a lot of time is spent in his house while my dogs run around in the yard around the camper. Well this morning i was drinking coffee with my dad in his living room when i got the gut feeling i need to check on my dogs. I opened the back door and yelled for them but i only saw my 1yo Golden Aussie, my 6yo JRT was no where to be seen. I go into panic mode, my logical side telling me to check the most dangerous places first i ran towards the busy road in front of my dads house and started calling for her and walking towards the even busier intersection at the end of his road. My dad joins me and starts walking the opposite direction towards the dead end of his road. Walking down the side of that road was absolutely stomach turning i was so scared i was going to find my dog on that road and not in a good way. I keep calling her and finally i hear a bark and i bolt in that direction, i found her roaming around the local elementary school parking lot, maybe 100ft from an incredibly busy intersection that has claimed the life of many animals and people alike. She ran right up to me as happy as could be and i picked her up and sobbed the whole walk home. When we got back we found where she got out from and secured all of the possible holes. This tiny little 11lb B CLIMBED THE CHAINLINK FENCE. she didnt even need any of the holes we spent an hour securing. So shes staying in her kennel for the time being inside of the camper. (IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ THE STORY AND WANT TO GET TO MY ACTUAL QUESTION START HERE!!) So i need recommendations on a good Geo fence that will work for an 11lb small dog (everything ive found is for bigger dogs) i rather my dog get a little zap than be hit by a car. id like to avoid burying a wire if i can but if it's the only way ill do whatever i can to keep my dog safe. The back yard of the house we are buying is completely chainlink so keeping her in is my absolute priority or at least keeping her from running into the road. Ive thought about tethering her when shes outside (she sleeps inside with us so she wouldn't be on a tether outside 24/) but i just know she would get tangled up and would be miserable with it. Ive thought about the Fi but that would only tell me shes out not keep her in.

now heres the issue. 
i live really far from where i go to college (2h commute one way so 4h daily) and im in stem so its a busy day. we were looking to live directly to the town where my uni is and get our own apartment and the dog is meant to be my christmas gift from my boyfriend even though i offered to go dutch and pay half or a portion at least because it doesnt feel fair even tho its my gift. 

we wont be moving til after christmas and im not sure how long my boss can keep the puppy with him after we buy it off of him. its also a lot considering wed be moving 2h ours away and getting a puppy on top of that. but this opportunity its a once in a blue moon kind, a perfect litter of my dream dog at a discounted rate just because he likes us and we work well for him. 

i struggle a lot with probably depression and anxiety and my old dog was a fantastic help for me, a wee emotional support baby. taking care of something small and living has always helped me take my mind of any negative stuff thats on my mind so not only would my dream come true about getting a dog again (we had to put my dog down in 2021 because she was too old) but id do better mentally.

2023-11-04,1699065993,Lower-energy breed recs for a couple in an apt," **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First on our (me &amp; bf) own, I grew up having a beagle, but got her as a puppy when i was a kid, so i wasnt her primary caretaker until i was 16ish &amp; she was 8 y/o. My parents worked busy jobs and sort of gave up on training after a couple weeks. she wasnt the most obedient but was house trained. BF was the primary caretaker of his family dog (mixed breed, looks like dachshund schnauzer maybe) for 7 years.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* no preference, but will likely look at rescue/adoption options before i seek a breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* friendly, CUDDLY, relatively low-energy, we arent super active but the dog will be taken out 3-4 times a day + trips to our small dog park daily. will need to be well-suited for living in an 800 sqft apt w me &amp; bf. no kids/pets of our own for foreseeable future but would prefer a dog that gets along with them! will need to be left alone for 4-6 hours, 3 times a week maximum.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* greyhounds, whippets, or italian greyhounds. ive heard sighthounds, are are good for apartment living. although ive heard iggys are notoriously tough to housebreak which doesnt sound great to me. maybe some type of poodle or poodle mix due to their friendly nature &amp; lack of shedding. the shedding with my silky soft beagle was absolutely INSANE.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* basic obedience commands such as sit, stay, get down, come, dont eat off plates, alerting me when they need to go out (our beagle rang a bell) &amp; maybe a few basic tricks like paw, roll over, etc.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not really my interest.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* as much time as i can, although honestly im not certain what the requirement is. my bfs work is seasonal so hes home most days &amp; im home about half of the day

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 3-4 walks a day + a trip to a small dog park daily. a trip to a larger dog park 1-2x a week? 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* im okay with brushing, i used to brush 2x a week but couldve stood to do it more. id clean ears, &amp; groom at home. (the elderly purebred beagle had a wholeeee host of health issues that i cared for in her final years.) for trims for long coat i might prefer a professional for a better final product &amp; would be willing to pay.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* small-medium ideally, but no bigger than a greyhound.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* shedding, minimal to medium, definitely nothing extreme like a golden. minimal barking since i live in an apartment. minimal slobber if possible.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* not crucial, but would be nice especially if i get a dog that likes to sprint &amp; stretch its legs.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly, so very clingy. i love dog affection, i never get tired of it &lt;3 &amp; its a big help with my mental health

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* eager-to-please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* i dont mind barking at knocking (gated complex so knocking is rare), but definitely friendly upon meeting strangers

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We frequently pass dog neighbors entering/exiting our apt. &amp; Our dog will interact with my bfs parents 2 dogs (separate households) from time to time.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Extreme shedding, extreme barking (love hounds but theyre a no for right now =*), a need for several hours of exercise daily. high aggression. Breeds that are frequently banned from apartment complexes if we ever want to move (Pitbulls, german shepards, staffordshires, etc). i dont think i want one of those white dogs that always looks dirty lol although theyre very sweet

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* at a maximum, 4-6 hours, 2-3x a week but generally less.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* bf &amp; i both love dogs &amp; he is home all day most days so will be more involved in caretaking. we visit our parents a lot, &amp; my parents will ONLY allow me to visit with the dog if it is house trained, well-mannered, obeys commands &amp; minimal shedding. so a dog that could fit this bill &amp; come hang out with the family would be amazing but not a deal breaker.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None of our own until we buy a house in several years. BFs mom has dachshund-schnauzer mix, bfs dad has labradoodle (25-30 lbs). they will definitely interact from time to time.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but may occasionally see my 9, 4, &amp; 2 y/o nephew &amp; nieces, who are all kind &amp; sort of indifferent to dogs. One nephew is allergic so a more hypoallergenic dog would be a massive plus.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Currently rent, no weight restrictions but restrictions on breeds known for aggression such as pitbulls, staffordshires, german shepards, dobermans, etc.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* fall-spring in DFW (none) &amp; summer in Denver (restrictions on pitbulls &amp; dogs in that family)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer 80-105, winter 40-50

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Ive heard senior dogs can be well suited for apartment living, my only qualm is that i lost my 15 y/o beagle early this year &amp; idk if i can bring myself to sign up for that heartache so much sooner after getting a dog. ): but on the other hand senior dogs need love &amp; a forever home too!! &amp; it sounds like were a great fit for one. Im highly conflicted in this aspect.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",dogs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17nc5lv/lowerenergy_breed_recs_for_a_couple_in_an_apt/
2023-11-04,1699102650,Traveling with large dogs,"Hi everyone! I have a great pyrenees and australian cattle dog mix who weighs roughly 70lbs and we take frequent short trips together (ranging from a few days to a week max). When we do travel, he sleeps in a 36 crate which is definitely tight, but he makes it work. In the car he travels in the doggy hammock with a seat belt. Im getting a bigger car so Im looking at some options to help make it a little more comfortable when we take trips together. 

How do you all travel with your large dogs and what do their sleeping arrangements look like? As of right now Im considering either keeping my current transport setup and getting a 42 crate or getting a large sized Gunner crate for transport and sleeping. I know the Gunner route would definitely be the safer bet given if anything were to happen to us, but my only concern is the inner dimensions are a little smaller length and width wise compared to a 36 crate. I know travel crates are supposed to be a little snug for safety reasons but I just want my dog to be comfortable when were staying at places =-. Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated!

2023-11-04,1699106648,I feel guilty but I regret taking a dog on when I work so much and have 2 cats already.,"I live alone with animals. I decided almost a year ago to adopt a dog. I did and honestly I regret it. I suffer from daily fatigue, my depression is bad, exercise doesn't help. I am gone for work 48 hours a week (commute and lunch added).   
The 2 cats were manageable as they don't require as much. But having this dog has brought me a lot of guilt. He needs so much and he requires so much money. He is home alone often unless my sister can sit with him a few times a week. He needs daily walks and even those don't tire him out while I'm left exhausted. I buy him toys and he destroys those the same day. He is so needy. Sometimes I just want to sit around and rot (after I walk him.) And he will stare at me in anticipation for more entertainment and adventures.   
Here the kicker; I am too attached to give him back to the foster/rescue woman. I  have tried twice and each time the day where I'm supposed to return him I get so emotional and cry and wonder if I'm doing the right thing then I decide to keep him...  
Depression has caused me to be so indecisive in life. Someone who works 48 hours with chronic depression/fatigue shouldn't own 2 cats &amp; a dog. I FEEL SO STUCK.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17nmcl7/i_feel_guilty_but_i_regret_taking_a_dog_on_when_i/

Info on our dog for ref: 14lb Chipoo-Yorkie mix, fits comfortably in an 18x11x11 carrier.

She doesn't like flying/the airport but is a quiet flyer, makes no noise and stays in her carrier the whole time as required. She won't really stand and turn on command.

2023-11-04,1699061801,Can I ensure safety between my cat and herding dog?,"Hey guys! First I want to give an update on my dog. I posted here awhile back asking the best way to help my big dog. Well. Hes officially allowed in the whole yard AND the downstairs of the house (upstairs is just the bedrooms and a small hallway that hes too big and clumsy for). 

Upstairs in my bedroom is where my cat lives. Her box, toys, and food/water is in my room and she never had much interest in leaving especially when I spend time playing with her. This is just because my mom didnt know she was allergic to my cat when we got her but now when Im home the cat is allowed wherever I am and when I leave shes happily kept in my room. 

Ill officially be moving out (hopefully) by December! All this saving paid off and I put an offer in at a cute place in the city-ish. What im trying to say is will I be able to leave them alone together? My dog chases things that run and my cat runs when shes scared. Theres still the option of leaving the dog at home but I cant ensure his quality of life then. Theyve NEVER been alone in the same room together for more than 15 mins and Im willing to work with them both but I want them to both have access to the whole house. Please let me know if this is possible and what steps I can take to do that. 

Dog behavior: excited herding breed, will herd if no other stimulation. Has ripped apart every stuffy, pillow, and bed hes ever had and doesnt watch where hes going. Has tripped over little dog several times. 

Cat behavior: skittish and jumpy. Will run if threatened. Will bite and scratch if threatened. 

I just want them to be happy and safe.

I think at home is the best option for my big dog if my mom agrees to work with him. But I want to see what yall think.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17nat81/can_i_ensure_safety_between_my_cat_and_herding_dog/

2023-11-04,1699061134,Advice - Bernese/Husky/Collie Puppy,"Hello =K

My fiancée and I applied and have been accepted for a foster-to-adopt puppy. The puppy is suspected to be a Bernese/Husky/Border Collie Mix from the NWT, Canada. We've been told that the mother is a Bernese/Husky mix and the father is unknown but the vet believes it to be a smaller breed (border collie or Aussie). The vet predicts that she'll be approximately 60 to 70lbs but without actually knowing the father it's hard to say.

We're moderately active and enjoy running, hiking, and backpacking, and I also mountain bike.

We're a bit concerned that the puppy may become too large/bulky for the types of activities that we enjoy doing. Once fully grown, it would ideally be able to mountain bike with me and go on longer hikes (10-15kms/6-10miles).

Does anyone have any experience with this type of mix? Would its stamina/agility allow for these types of activities?

We're trying to do our due diligence to make sure our lifestyle would be a good fit and any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks!

She loved loved loved her sniff walks and going out into the world, and now that we have her just at home, she is starting to get unusually mischievouspeeing inside when she hasnt had an accident in weeks, jumping up on beds which she knows she isnt supposed to and then performing zoomies in the sheets, shredding mail, going after the house plants, counter surfing for miscellaneous items, the list goes on and on. 

We have been trying to mentally stimulate her as much as possible, but she is a smart smart cookie and gets through all of the games we have set up way too quickly.  We have done an assortment of kibble puzzles (she finishes them in 2 mins), we have done snuffle mats, we have done the rubber ball that you stuff with towels that have rolled up kibble (done in 10 mins), we have done rolling treat dispensing balls, we have done puppy-teeth safe chews, we have done fozen enrichment bowls (with pumpkin, bone broth, Greek yogurt layers), we have done new trick training, we have sat on the front porch watching people
passing by, we have played with brand new toys. However, I dont feel like any of this is enoughwhich is very apparent with her energy level still. 

In terms of physical exercise, we have tossed her balls and played tug in the backyard, but that exacerbates the cough and she gets winded pretty quickly.

Just so Im not saying the same thing over and over, thank you for all your comments assuring me its completely normal and that for so many of you it got better with time. Its already helped me so much I felt so trapped in these feelings and they were getting worse because its all I could think about but I feel so relieved now and theyre already annoying me less just knowing that its not forever. I think I am more hormonal than I thought I was too because Ive been fine mentally and not emotional I think I keep forgetting that Ive literally just had a baby and Im actually going through a crazy time no matter how well Ive managed to adapt. Hopefully the (majority) responses to this post will help somebody in the future if they are searching for it like I was before I posted. 

Looking for positive stories about dogs (that you already had) after babies. For context incase it matters, I have two 5 year old male (neutered) Beagles.

Im looking for anybody that might of been through similar but it turned around. Since having my baby 6 weeks ago, I no longer like my dogs. I find everything about them annoying and the bad habits they have that I used to think were soooooo cute make me absolutely enraged. I assume its the hormones and being touched out from looking after a tiny human 24/7 and not ever getting a break from that because this is seriously out of character for me. A year ago I would of died for my dogs. We paid the price of a house deposit to emigrate them across the world with us because we never for a moment considered rehoming them and being in a better financial position (we are literally currently renting because of this decision). I have always thought of them like my children but all of a sudden I can see they are dogs.

I think I still love them, but I just really dont like them right now. I cant explain it, I dont want them near me I dont find them cute or want to spend time with them. They still have the same routine and walks, and my husband still treats them the same, and they have adapted well to the baby after the first couple of days. I am making an effort to still give them some attention so they dont feel it too much, but Im having to force myself because I just dont want to, its the weirdest thing. Also every other thing is annoying me too, other peoples dogs, noises in the house so I definitely think its hormone driven. I just want to know if you went through this and it got better?

 If you went through this and it didnt get better please dont tell me because that will just make me feel worse. Also I know I cant police comments, but if youve not had children please dont assume you know what this feels like (get rid of the baby not the dog!) because I used to judge people for these feelings very harshly too, its completely different when you are in the situation. They are not mistreated or neglected in any way and will never be so. They wont be rehomed either just to preface, and I plan on getting a dog trainer to help us reconnect and iron out some bad habits when my baby is old enough to be entertained for a little while so I can dedicate some time to that.

2023-11-03,1699041875,im eventually going to need a service dog due to physical disability,"
 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have had small breed dogs (boston terrier, yorkie, maltipoo). id prefer my service dog to already be trained but i dont mind some specific training while my body isnt wheelchair bound yet. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* i prefer to have a dog from a reputable breeder who can train for service

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* big enough to help me off the floor as needed, working dog but doesnt need a lot of exercise

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* right now, im thinking poodle, id just have to keep the coat shaved most of the year

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* i need physical assistance, grabbing some objects, stays near me and alerts me when my heart rate gets too high, can help me get to the ground safely and can pull me back up tug of war style

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* obedience is the most important but i can stand to be ignored from time to time or entice with treats if needed

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* im unable to work so i have all day to interact with the dog, my partner works but he could help exercise the dog but likely not every day, but several times a week

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* my partner would be able to take it on walks, i can go on walks at this point in my disability but eventually i wont be able to

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* im very comfortable doing most grooming, but id prefer a dog that either doesnt need to be brushed, or can be shaven during spring and summer

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* i weigh 105 pounds, so any dog thats sturdy enough to help me when i fall/alert me that my heart rate will cause me to fall

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* id prefer little to no shedding, not super loud as i have a cat (she may not be alive by the time service dog is needed, but thats not a guarantee), and not much slobber outside of being licked

I have 3 dogs. Buddy (1 year old), culver (3 years old), and Rosie (5 years old).

Some context: Rosie is very prone to resource guarding. Shell growl and snap at anything deemed hers. Weve tried to stop this habit, but at the time she was an only dog, so my parents decided to let her do what she wants.

Then we got Culver, then Buddy. Culver stays out of her way, but Buddy is a baby and wants to be her friend, which she is very much against. This, I believe, has started the urination issue in our home. Buddy will pee on Rosies food, on Rosie if theyre both outside, or where she last was. It has escalated to the point where hell pee on any surface. Weve tried to take him out every 30 minutes, positive reinforcement, but so far nothing has improved. Weve had to put diapers on Buddy, but he finds a way to pee around them.

My father is at the ends of his wits, but I believe theres something we can do about Rosies guarding and Buddys peeing. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I have two rather rambunctious doggos, and we will frequently end up by rivers/creeks/streams. They will swim if it is above freezing, and there is no stopping them. Playtime also usually involves bombing through the forests and brush at full tilt and a fair bit of wrestling. Lots of great fun.  However, with it now getting super dark super early, I'm looking for some kind of light-up collar or collar light I can hang on them that is able to take the abuse that comes with rough play, chasing ducks into the river, swimming, etc, etc, etc. 

I keep looking and see some that say ""waterproof"" in various parts of the description, but when you read in detail it says ""but not swimming"" so they aren't actually waterproof.  Some even have photos of dogs with the collars lit up diving underwater in one product image, and the very next says don't use swimming.

One of our dogs went blind pretty quickly last year. He was always a reactive dog and fell in the aggressive category when triggered. He's a smaller-medium sized dog. He was a great dog 95% of the time except for the 5% when he'd be aggressive. I have been bit several times by him. Then after he went blind he stopped being aggressive and has been extremely sweet. 

We just brought our first baby home from the hospital. None of the dogs were interested in smelling his hat or blanket. The two non blind dogs know what's going on and have showed minor interest in the baby, but nothing too much. 

Our blind dog now has a foreign crying thing in  the house and is extremely interested in getting to exactly where the baby is (but we haven't let him get too close to the baby out of fear). He has growled at the baby from a close distance when the baby was crying. He also has barked when the baby cries.

2023-11-07,1699379912,How much time do you spend with your dog?,"
I feel like I'm spending too much time with my dog to the point where I can barely get anything else done for myself. Don't get me wrong, she's my best friend and I enjoy every second with her, but I need to get stuff done, too. She's a 9 month old Doberman. 

For context, I'm a college student and also work full time, 9 hours per day. 

Here is how our day goes; I wake up in the morning, get dressed for work, prepare my dog's food, go on a 30 minute walk, then a 10 minute play session (either fetch or running around the yard), then 30 minutes of resting before feeding her. I then head to work, leaving her in a secluded area in our yard which is 14'x14' with some toys to play with. She doesn't play much, but instead spends the time sleeping.

Since I live very close to work, I use my break time to take her on another 30 minute walk before leaving again. Finally, I make it back home in the evening and I spend the rest of my day with her, running around and playing fetch, usually from 8 PM until 10:30 or 11 PM. I then clean up after her and then head to bed only to wake up and repeat.

On my days off, the entire day is spent with her. Is the",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17q062j/how_much_time_do_you_spend_with_your_dog/

2023-11-07,1699377598,Getting ready for a new dog,"I have been thinking about getting another dog. My last dog passed over 5 years ago and I am finally ready to move forward. My last dog, while he was a pain, he really was a fairly easy dog to deal with inside the house.

The dog I am considering is a 2 year old female Shepherd mix (possibly mixed with Rottweiler) that weighs about 65 lbs. The prison I work at has a training program with the local animal shelter so I see her almost daily right now. She's very smart. Walks well on a leash and knows a few tricks. She doesn't dig holes and only jumps on the dog run fence if you walk up to it. But she isn't a big fan of strangers and takes a little to warm up to people.

One of the issues I am having about bringing her home is, its too late in the year to put up a fence for her. I work nights on 8 hour shifts and anywhere from 3 to 5 16 hour shifts every pay period. When I am not home, my Dad will be able to let her out and play with her in the yard but he can't walk as sometimes he needs to use a walker due to a bad ankle. A tie out will limit how much she can run around the yard. Is some kind of welded fence like chicken wire or hog fence with t posts a decent short term option to give her some play area and little bit of a barrier from anything coming up to her? She will never be outside unattended. She does listen very well, but is still a dog. Eventually, I will build her a fenced in yard but its northern Michigan we have already had some snow and most days mid 40s is as warm as it gets so a permanent solution has to wait.

She is crate trained. The crate she is used to is very enclosed/private and decent sized, maybe 3ftx3-4ft. I would like to get her something similar so she is comfortable. So far all I have found is the standard wire and plastic crates. Are some of the end table/furniture crates bigger? Obviously, if nothing exists like her current crate she might have to adjust.

She also appears to have some food sensitivities. Originally, she was being fed 4Health Lamb and Rice, but it was upsetting her stomach and she was having diarrhea nonstop. They switched her to some Purina Rice and Salmon kibble. She is still very soft but no longer having diarrhea. Obviously, I would have my vet look at her and find out what the actual issue is. I have never dealt with a dog with sensitivities or allergies, I have no idea what to expect or what kind of diet to give her or what brand is considered quality and safe. 

I haven't fully decided for getting her. I am used to dogs that love everyone immediately or are fine as soon as I say the person is okay, she is not that way. She warms up on her own schedule and it takes her a few meetings to accept someone, then once she does that person is her friend and she is quite protective of them. As much as she is a sweetheart and I like her, I won't bring her home if my house can't be made right to fit her.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17pzac3/getting_ready_for_a_new_dog/

The breeder also wants us to put a $500 non-refundable security deposit down to secure the dog. They do come with a one year health warranty.

The dog is somewhere around 6 month old, female, likely amstaff x ??? cross bread, very sweet and adorable. She's well behaved with humans and other dogs although lacking proper early training it seems as she barely knows to sit or stay on command (learning pretty quickly). From what I understand she was not badly mistreated by previous owner but probably neglected to some extent.

The thing is we have zero experience with dogs and were not expecting to have one, so mostly unprepared and head scratching about the long term implications of having a new furry family member. 

We already have a cat at home and monitoring a slow introduction that is going well. They started to show a keen interest to each other and went as far as making nose contact but I can feel that the dog is struggling with prey dive instincts whenever the cat is jumping around. When would you know it is safe to let them be unsupervised?

I am also wondering about character changes going into adulthood, at the moment she's the nicest of dogs, bonded quickly with us, only playfully bites a bit when cuddling (it is gentle, still trying to take care of that). However I don't know what to expect when growing older. Is character well defined at 6 month already or is it still likely to develop ? I am mostly worried she could express challenging behaviors growing older since we don't have much space left for addressing difficult situations. Obviously we would take education seriously but as I know almost nothing about her genetics I am not sure it is enough to relay on.

Also, my daughter tends to be in and out to her boyfriend's place. Could it be problematic for a young dog to regularly switch between two different homes?

2023-11-07,1699321449,DOG BEHAVIOUR ADVICE,"Hi hello bonjour, my family and I are first time dog owners who got an aussiedoodle puppy 2 years ago (so he is now just over two years old) and my dog does this thing where he growls, barks, and bites (not hard but he still like kinda bites) if you move your feet or sometimes even hands around him. For example, I was lying in my bed under my blanket and he wanted to come up on my bed so I let him but when I moved my feet under my blanket he freaked out and bit my feet. He does this even if there is no blanket and its just my legs or my hands. Or earlier today, he was sitting on the sofa which has a blaket on it to cover the sofa. The blanket slipped behind him so when I pulled it up back onto the top of the sofa, he again freaked out, growled, barked, and tried to bite me. He's generally a pretty chill dog and only really barks otherwise at the doorbell or the occasional dog we see while walking (but that's usually just out of excitement). It's not just me he does this with everyone in the family. The only time I've ever seen him actually aggressive is when he got bullied by this other dog but otherwise he honestly just keeps to himself. 

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated because I have no idea on where to even start with trying to get him to calm down in these situations. Thank you!",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17pj939/dog_behaviour_advice/

I have a female Maltese. She has been sprayed, and absolutely adores me, follows me around with no leash around the house and outside. Also, I have 2 sons, of which the younger one is 8 years old. Now, this kid also loves the dog but expresses it in a way that is stressful for the dog. Holding her on her back, chasing her... The dog also loves him and is protective of him. When I play with my son I sometimes act like I bite him and she always tries to stop me by barking, play biting me, or digging under me.

The problem is that every 2-3 weeks the dog pees on my son's bed. After the act when I harshly look at her, she cowers and it looks to me knows why I am upset. I have no idea what to do to stop this kind of behavior.

2023-11-06,1699272843,How to help a dog I got from the shelter?,"Back story: (not really necessary to read, but relevant I guess) 

So I recently moved in with my cousin and his wife. I come over frequently (were basically brothers)  and got to know the dog before I moved in. Theyve also had another dog for a long time that is a similar breed and wanted to get another dog. The new dog also oddly has very similar name to my mom, Fran 


What I know about the dogs history: 
Age - Between 3-4 years old. 
Spent 18 months in the shelter, went home with two separate families and came back each time. 
The dog has been at the house about 5 months now. 

My assumptions: 
Im going to assume this dog was planned to be used as a hunting dog, and maybe it didnt work out. Some hunters will either kill the dog, or abandon it somewhere. 

The problem: 
Besides being scared easily by loud noises she seems to do well. She will react to someone dropping something. When she gets distracted investigating something in the yard and youre able to sneak up on her she becomes fearful and jumps back real quick and then seems to realize its okay. 

When she is sleeping, or laying down and its quiet and calm and not a lot going on when you get up to grab something (just reach out)  near her she is ready to attack. She has never bitten me, its more like shes worried I mean harm and I caught her off guard so she wants me to go away. She does this with my cousin too. The thing I find odd is shes aware of who we are and what are smells are like and still does it. For example, shell sleep with my cousin and his wife. My cousin will get up in the middle of the night to piss and when he comes back shes snaps at him. 


Last time she did it to me, it was like she collapsed her front legs on the couch as if she knew she was wrong. A lot of times after these events she seems to come to you and sort of apologize. She has never actually  bitten me once and if she really wanted to she could have several times. 

Outside of that one small thing shes a great dog.


I figured in time the issue would be fixed. Were all nice people, treat her great. When these events happen we kinda stand there and try and let her know its ok and we dont mean harm. Kinda try to pet her and comfort her. Is the last part proper or should we handle it differently? I dont know if she understands, or if it would be seen as rewarding the dog?",dogs,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17p1d3c/how_to_help_a_dog_i_got_from_the_shelter/

2023-11-06,1699285757,Cat attacks dog all the time,"We adopted a doberman x 7 months ago, she's now 11 months old, we have a siamese ziki (3) and a tabby athena (2) training has been going great, apart from the seperation anxiety, she excels in almost anything she's, really well behaved, she rarely even tries to play with the cats. 

But when she does iniate play I always make sure to stop it as you can see it scares them as she is very big. That being said she's not relentless she doesn't chase them or try to play with them all the time, as she's more interested in her own toys and us, I like to put that to spending alot of time trying to twach her to relax around the flat and the cats.

Ziki always used to hiss and occasionally swat at her but recently he has started to attack her for what seems to be no reason, he can open doors, he will open the door saunter in, look at her and then just launch himself, he doesn't make a noise just starts attacking her, we kept stopping it and just making the cat leave the room, now ziki never use to come.into the living room, he would always chill in the bedroom, but since we've had the dog he comes in, the dog used to bother ziki when she was younger (by bowing and then just going crazy) but we nipped that in the bud through separating  them and redirecting her unto toys or through telling her to sit or go to place etc...

Anyway, last night I was cleaning the skirting in the hallway so took the dog with me, she poked her nose into the kitchen but then her ears like flattened and she started to walk backwards really quick, until she got to my.legs. It was at this point ziki has come into the doorway, looked at her and then just sprinted towards her attacked her and then ran off back to the kitchen, she was a bit nervous so I told the dog to sit and started to feed her for listening and staying with me, them when I told her to go into the living room, the cats turned around and gone crazy, flipping and spinning with his claws out, all aiming at the dogs chest and face. As I went to stop it the dog has lowered her face and bared her teeth towards his knape. I separated and crated her (I don't know if this was the right course of action but its all I knew to do in the moment), then today while I've been at college he's attacked the dog again and my partner has rung me crying because she'd left the room for about a minute just to.go.toilet, she'd closed the living room door but when she got back the door was open, she could hear then fighting and the dog was pinning the cat with her paws, as in paws on his neck and chest holding him in place as he went nuts.

We live in a flat that is quite spacious, but we're on the list waiting on a 2 bedroom house, we get the dog out alot and mentally and physically exercise her as she is a doberman and needs that. After doing reading i do realise thay this is probably all my fault as i wanted a dog but A we live in a flat and B we already had 2 cats.

The only time ziki comes into the living room he will attack her, he never use to go in before we got the dog, and at this point we're regretting it as I don't want the dog to end up hurting him, and ideally I don't want to rehome the dog, call it selfishness but I love her and I don't want to have to get rid of her, when she could end up somewhere bad and she's really bonded with me, I've never felt this type of.love from any animal its so strange and I need advice om how to fix this, is it fixable by training at home or I do look.for a specialist, don't be afraid to criticise me at all, I feel like shit, my partner feels like shit but at the end of the day it is what it is and I just need to try and fix this.

I have seen a lot of dog owners on Chewy and on this forum talk about a recent change in Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin / Stomach formulas and how it is negatively affecting their dogs. Nobody has gotten an answer from Purina themselves so I tried to reach out and I DID get an answer on what exactly is different& they removed probiotics! I am copying and pasting their reply below. Hope this is helpful to some to be aware of& 

Thank you for contacting Purina.

With increased demand and a temporary supply constraint of the probiotic ingredient we use in our formulas, weve taken a proactive step to ensure product availability by removing probiotics. Providing the highest quality and safety standards remains the top priority for all Pro Plan dog foods.

We would not typically expect dogs to experience intestinal upset, or any other health concern, when eating the new recipe. That said, some dogs with a sensitivity to diet change may benefit from a gradual diet transition to the new formula. 
 
We encourage any consumer with a concern about their dog's experience with one of our dog foods to consult with their veterinarian. Our products are 100% safe to feed.

2023-11-06,1699296309,Question about deposits&,"Hi there! So we put a deposit on a German Shepherd litter, we initially said we would be fine with either a male or female but made it clear we were very much hoping for a female. When the puppies were born there were not enough females born for us and we started having doubts, but the breeder said since she has top pick of the litter she is most likely to drop out. So we kept our spot, hoping she would not take the female. She also said we could transfer our deposit to a future litter (this is important).

Well the pups turned 3 weeks old and the breeder strongly hinted towards her wanting to keep the female. I told her we have decided not to go with a male and would rather wait for a future female. The breeder told us the deposit is only transferrable until theyre 2 weeks old so we would have to place a separate deposit if the male puppy doesnt get adopted before 8 weeks.

We are pretty distraught about this and were wondering if this was normal? I am well aware that deposits are non-refundable but we are not asking for it back, we merely would like it transferred. We have bought 4 purebred cats from reputable breeders so we are familiar with the process but have never heard of it. I am trying to understand her point of view but I fail to. I also wanted to mention that we did not sign a contract and there is no mention of this on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

Introduction  
  
Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be mine and my partners first dog as adults but we both grew up with dogs (him BCs, me working and show line labs and ex racing grey hounds) and are our family and friends go to for dog sitting so we have looked after bull terriers, golden retrievers, spaniels and rescue mutts  
  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

We would like to go to a reputable breeder.

  
Describe your ideal dog.  
  
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Old English Sheepdog - I love to groom animals so the ultra long hair appeals to me, they have the smarts, desire to please and energy of working breeds but are almost exclusively showline in the UK so are a bit 'softer'.

Flat coated retriever - I adore retrievers but my other half wants to try something a little different (as we have been around a load of labs and goldens). I think a flat coat fits this bill, plus they are a little less push button than a lab or golden which appeals, I like a bit of sass in my animals. 

White swiss Shepard - We both adore German Shepards but are not sure we'd be able to handle that much dog, from research white swiss seems to be very similar to GSDs (smart, driven, loyal, energetic) but a notch or two down from a GSD. Bonus points that they are a 'grumble-y' breed and we both love chatty animals.

Other half is dead set against a lab or golden, having been around a lot of them he likes them but says they don't feel like the right breed for him, he can't articulate why but he feels it in his soul. I don't want a terrier or Sighthound, similar to my other half I just don't vibe with them as much as I like them.   
  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience and solid recall are must haves. We are toying with the idea of training the dog to help with my ADHD (get me my meds and help to interrupt hyper focus and overstimulation).  
  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I wouldn't want to compete but I would want to take part, I'm not fussed what we do (agility/flyball/rally ect.) I just want an activity that I can do with a doggy partner and have some fun and social time.  
  
Care Commitments  
  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Realistically we can dedicate up to 4 hours throughout the day.   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We can do 1-2 hours of off leash sniffing/running in the nearby country parks during the week and longer on the weekend. Ultimately looking for a hiking buddy, we live near the peak district and I want to spend as much time as possible there when the dog is old enough.   
  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I adore brushing, it's not the same but we have a long haired cat (half persian) and grooming him is one of my favourite activities, I could do it until he was bald.   
  
Personal Preferences  
  
10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large, no smaller than a Border collie  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Don't mind shedding, house is covered in cat hair anyway. I don't mind a bit of barking but don't want to p-off the neighbours. Prefer less slobber but if it's for the right dog then sign me up to become a walking tissue  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important, the vast majority of exercise will be off leash in the semi-rural area around my house  
  
Dog Personality and Behavior

I finally got it, and thought I would share in case anyone else is in a similar situation!

4. About 1/2 of the drained water is poured onto a lick mat, then frozen

2023-11-06,1699284348,My dog hates me,"My Shiba is 2.5yo. Since day 1, I've been the one training/disciplining/caring for her. This includes crate training after coming in from outside, washing her paws when they are muddy, cutting her nails, bathing etc. She hates all of these but especially when her feet are touched so any of those things that must be done she hates and I think she resents me for it.

She'll never come in when I call her or I WFH in the basement and 8 hours she won't come visit me at all. When my wife or son calls, she comes right in or when they come down the basement, she'll follow - so I know it's not dislikes for those places.

I'm the only one that feeds or plays fetch (fav activity) and try to buy her love with treats, but nothing works. She sit with me when she's forced to, but only because it's the only comfortable spot. If I even look at her weird, she'll jump off the couch to get away. She'll let me pick her up to hold or let me kiss her face and she's not aggressive towards me or anyone so its doesn't make sense...

2023-11-06,1699275290,First dog recommendations,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* Yes, this will be my first dog. I have looked after dogs for friends and neighbours but never for more than a week. This has included older rescue dogs with lots of anxiety and young retriever/labrador puppies. I've never had one myself though.  
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I'm more inclined to rescue, as all my previous pets have been rescues and I'd prefer to help out a dog in need of a home. However, I'm aware I'm not experienced with the possible behaviour and needs of rescue dogs and could potentially avoid this by raising and training my own puppy, so that is also a consideration.  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* A dog I can take on long walks during the day and cuddle up with at night. They'd need to eventually be okay with being alone for a few hours at a time, but this can be built up. I'd prefer minimal slobber, but am okay with grooming &amp; shedding.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I'm open to the majority of breeds. I've not had great experiences with tiny breeds and would prefer something slightly larger than a Chihuahua, up to around the size of a Labrador. I'd like to avoid breeds with known respiratory issues like pugs. I've spent time with a friend's Border Collies and adored their intelligence, stamina, and affection. I'm not convinced I could give a Border Collie the physical and mental stimulation they need, unfortunately.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* I'd love to train them to have near perfect recall. Basic obedience training and being able to wait patiently to greet guests as well.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* I'd like to spend the majority of my time with my dog. I work from home 4 days a week and would be able to hire a dog walker or use a dog daycare for the day I am at work. While I should have plenty of time to dedicate to my dog, I would like an hour or so a day of rest where I can trust my dog to not get too mischievous.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* I'm open to 2-3 x 1-hour long walks a day during the week. I usually go out for longer walks or bike rides at the weekend and a hike once a month or so. I have a few parks that are a 30-minute walk away (or a quick drive to) that I'd enjoy going to a few times a week. I have a medium garden they can run around in too.   
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I'm willing to do daily brushing and whatever grooming needs to be done regularly.   
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
Ideally, something around the size of a spaniel, though I'm flexible. I do have family members who visit occasionally and have a fear of dogs, so preferably nothing bigger than a Labrador. I'm also around 5'5"" and would prefer a dog that can't overpower me.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* I'm okay with lots of shedding. I can handle some barking and slobber but would prefer these to be minimal.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* In an ideal world, I'd love to have the freedom to do this. My garden is surrounded by hedges and is unlikely entirely dog-proof currently. I am happy to use temporary fencing so they can run around if need be. I would love the ability to go on long walks or hike with an off-leash dog but this isn't a requirement.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* I'd like somewhere in the middle. I'd enjoy cuddles, but it might be too much to have a dog that clings to me constantly.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* I'm okay with either.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* As my family and best friend both have some fear of dogs, I'd like them to be able to wait patiently to greet them and not jump up on them. Some reaction to door-knocking is okay but I'd prefer them not to go crazy.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* To an extent. I'm happy to keep dog interactions to a minimum but I'm aware I'm not experienced and don't wish to take on more than I can handle.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* I'd like to avoid people agression if possible.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* At most 2-3 hours a day with the exception of one day a week. I work 8 hours in an office one day a week but am willing to enlist a dog walker or daycare. I can also likely be with the dog for 30 minutes over lunch. There may be occasions of more like 4-6 hours but any longer and I would ensure someone would be there for them.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* I live alone and will take on all caring responsibilities.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* I have 5 guinea pigs. Should the dog prove calm enough and ignore them, I'm okay with having them in the room while I'm there. At all other times the door to their room will be locked and inaccessible to the dog, possibly always should I not be comfortable with any interaction. This would depend on the dog's temperament but cats are a possibility in the future. This isn't essential, but having grown up with cats, I'd like my own one day.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* Unlikely.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* I rent from family members and expect to keep doing so until I can have my own house. There are no restrictions on my lease.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* I live in Scotland, and there are a few breeds with bans. These are;

Pit bull terrier type.  
Japanese Tosa type.  
Dogo Argentino type.  
Fila Braziliero type.  
Any other type of dog appearing to be or to have characteristics of the above type bred for fighting.

It is unclear whether the UK ban on XL bully dogs will apply to Scotland but I would also avoid this type.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* 15-17°C (or 59-63 °F) in the summer, 5°C (41°F) in the winter.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

2023-11-06,1699273487,Strange interaction a moment ago. >#=>ã>à,"So my dog (not even a year old, German Shepard/Siberian Husky mix) came up behind me as I laid back down in bed from using the toilet (stomachs upset), and then proceeded to lick the my ear and back of my head for anywhere from 5-10 mins.
While It wasnt a negative experience, I just let it happen thinking shell bore herself (took a lot longer than I thought =) and I was like = the whole time.

After which, she just stared off into space, panted kinda hard, and then casually just walked off the bed and laid in her bed, been there since as I typed this, not a peep or panting.

So im wondering if any dog whisperers here may have any idea what this may mean, is she sampling me for a meal later? Locking my taste/scent in her memory? Or is she just weird &amp; dumb?

More information to work with-to build an understanding to now.

From the day that I found her (May 1st 2023, no chip, collar, identification of any kind &amp; absolutely alone), she has been an extremely scary puppy, who took to my other dog (senior mini schnauzer) very well, but remained rather scared of me that manifested as her just staying under the couch for the most part, but came out freely to interact minor bits, eat or bathroom before secluding once again, 6 months later to now, she still has her hidey spot, but acknowledges her name, my calls and some of my commands, but refuses to not only be super anxious around other humans but some rare cases of being scared.
Shes not loud, she doesnt randomly bark (unless purposely hassling or playing with my other dog I really should have used names here) and is extremely chill, curious &amp; laid back to most things, but shows very skittish behavior to all things.

Her interactions with my other dog (who is profoundly lazy at this point) does irk her cause one is full of puppy energy and spunk an the other is just tired and old (you get the idea).

Ahhhhhh, potty training is going extremely well, still need a bit more work to smooth out the edges.

Hope that helps to paint a fuller picture leading up to the head licking, OH! Extra caveat, ONE TIME when she was a young puppy, I was holding her and laying down, and she proceeded to gnaw on my beard, and never did it again after that. I always chalked it up as her learning what human facial hair was? Oh well.

2023-11-06,1699273008,How to re-socialise my dog with other dogs?,"So my 10 month old Cane Corso, Ace, was so good around other dogs as a puppy. However, one day whilst a pup, he was nipped by a much smaller, off-lead dog. An argument then proceeded between me and the owner of the other dog. Since then, hes not known to be nice to other dogs and very wary of people.

If he sees another dog (hes always on the lead) - he is desperate to get to it. He lunges towards it. But hes not aggressive and snarling, its as if he wants to play. On the odd occasion when hes been within touching distance of another dog, hell nip it. But its not an aggressive bite, just a nip. However, a dog his size, just nipping a smaller dog, may well hurt it.

Now I know Cane Corsos are fiercely protective dogs, so theres always that element. But he was growling at an old lady who literally wanted to say hello and give him some of her sausage roll!

Im stuck in a vicious circle. He cant socialise with other dogs for fear of nipping. Yet the only way to seemingly resolve it, is to socialise him.

Im having some dog training sessions currently - their advice is to distract him with food to stop him lunging. Which is fine. But I want him to be able to socialise with other dogs nicely eventually.

I adopted my now 8-month-old dog, Bodevan, 6 months ago (it is the first time I have adopted a dog) and it has been amazing. He has learned so much and he is very playful and is never violent either with other dogs or with people. To my frustration, I have been unable to manage his increasing fear of strangers (especially children and trolleys). Every time we go out or when somebody new comes to the house he keeps barking because he is afraid. Even though I try to keep him calm and ease him as much as I can, this behaviour continues. I know that he would not hurt anybody but I understand that random people on the street can be afraid of Bodevan when he barks (or ""charges"" at them barking) because of his size. I do not have the money right now to take him for professional training so I wanted to know what advice would you give me so I can control the barking and, especially, the fear.

My partner and I have been thinking about adding a dog to our home for a while. We visited a breeder who is expecting puppies soon(ish). The dogs seemed great and a good fit for us. So once it is confirmed that puppies are on the way we will probably say yes to one. 
While I am very excited about the idea of picking up a puppy and getting a new family member I also have this nervous gut feeling.


Are we ready for the commitment? How will our lives change? Will it be happy with us and so on.
We have done a lot of research and will continue to do so but the excitement is still mixed with a nervousness. 
How did you feel before picking up your first puppy? Was it just pure excitement and happiness or was there some mixed emotions as well?


Just to clarify, we have been toying with the idea of picking up a puppy for several months so a lot of thought has gone into this decision.

2023-11-06,1699259219,My dog won't walk without me and my dad,"Hi, I've had my pup for about 6 months now. She's currently 8 months old. Since the beginning, me and my dad had been walking her together as we both wanted to get used to it but also for safety reasons (in case we encounter an aggressive stray or person lol). We never really thought anything of it and it just became a habit to walk her together. When we did at some point try to walk her seperately, she did ok and walked normally. She stopped here and there when she saw something that scared her but after a while would continue walking. However, recently, she won't budge. Whether it's me or my dad, she'll stop out of nowhere and just won't move. I worry it's possible that she only feels secure when the both of us are with her now. Thankfully we've been free at the same time and have been able to walk her together but this won't be the case forever, especially since my dad is getting older and I'm gonna be moving out in a few years.

2023-11-06,1699257194,Advice needed before getting first dog,"Hello! Im planning on getting my first dog in about a year or so (most likely the ""so""). I'm 22 with a job (dog grooming) and stable income. Despite being a dog and cat groomer, I've never actually owned a dog of my own.

My family has had dogs in the past, but i was either very young or they were extended family's dogs we baby sat when they went on vacation. These dogs included a beagle mix when i was 4yrs old, my uncles german shepherds, my grandma's border collies, and my aunt's chocolate lab. 

With background experience on the grooming side, I've gravitated towards a few breeds as potential dogs for me. Standard poodle, Pomeranian, or perhaps a german shepherd. When i was younger i wanted a samoyed... nope XD 

I am decently active and enjoy walks, especially short (2-3 mile) hikes thru local nature parks and reserves. Dog grooming is thankfully a decently flexible job and i get plenty of hours before and after work in which i have free time.

I'm a bit concerned though that my inexperience with raising and training a dog will leave my eventual friend being unruly or poorly trained, something which would be disasterous in all of my listed breeds. 

I also have a pet cat, but he has always been very good around extended family's dogs and i don't believe he would cause the dog problems (mostly thinking about him with a pomeranian). 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm asking so far ahead because I definately don't want to rush into such a big commitment.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17oxr8s/advice_needed_before_getting_first_dog/
2023-11-06,1699255675,Things you wish you could have done,"Well the time has arrived this time around. I lost my first dog Butterscotch when I was in 8th grade. I never really went looking for a new dog and wasnt gun ho about finding one either.

What happened instead was I was asked by a friend if I could watch a puppy for a few days while they found a better place to home. His name was Cid. He was named Cid because his original owners had dosed him with LSD, then they were arrested and the girl who was trying to take care of him couldnt keep him at her place and asked if I could watch him a few days. I asked what kind of dog he is and she said hes a puppy German Shepherd. So I agreed to a few days. So what ultimately happened was he peed on my leg, threw up in my bed,  and won over my heart. Two months went by and I called her back and asked if he was actually a German Shepherd, because he wasnt growing at a rate that Id expected a German Shepherd puppy to grow at. Anyway, I aptly adjusted his name to ***Cid Vicious*** and he has been one of the greatest blessings in my life. I love this dog and I would do anything and everything for him that I could possibly do. He was born in November 2008. 

My little guy is an old man now, hes began showing signs of what I would equate to dementia, doesnt like being picked up anymore, he barks throughout the night like hes lost and doesnt know where he is. If there was any way to mitigate the pain he seems to be in constantly I would be willing to do everything possible, but in my mind I know that I wouldnt want to be kept around continuously in pain and confused just because others might miss me. I dont think that Cid wants that either. So Im trying to figure out what are the best things I can do with him and for him. Ive already scheduled for it to take place next Saturday through a service that drives to the home and the procedure is done in the home. 

So any thoughts or ideas would be nice to consider.

2023-11-06,1699243173,Transitioning food for senior dog,"Hello, fellow dog lovers! I have a small dilemma I need some advice on. Any help is appreciated.

My dog, a 10-year-old Border Collie - terrier mix, has been having stomach issues for the past few months. She will eat junk to make herself throw up, then she's fine for a while until she does it again. We're going to set up a vet appointment very soon, but in the mean time, it was suggested that maybe her stomach just can't handle her usual dog food anymore. 

We get the Purina Kibbles and Bits for her and our other dog, a 5-year-old husky. We keep their food and water bowls full and accessible. They only eat when they are hungry and thirsty, and are not overweight. If I am to go about getting a different food for my senior dog, how would I stop her from eating the Purina food? I'd imagine I would have to start putting them both on an eating schedule to make sure they don't eat each other's food. 

I am also concerned about finding a food the Border Collie will like. She has gotten increasingly picky over the years to the point where she only likes 2-3 kinds of treats and maybe 2 types of toys. Outside of the Purina food, she loves peanut butter flavored treats and meat chews. 

Any advice for better foods for the husky and Border Collie is also appreciated. I know there are higher quality foods out there, but most of them are too expensive.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ou9h3/transitioning_food_for_senior_dog/
2023-11-06,1699241584,"Dog Park - etiquette, expectations and other people&","Looking for opinions on something.

So was at the dog park today with my two year old dogs. Ones loud but not aggressive. A seven month old dog was there, also a little loud, but not aggressive, then a rescue greyhound with very chill temperament, and a couple rolled up with their 9 month old dog on his first trip to the park - after convincing them to let him off leash he got on well with the rest, had good time playing with mine once he got over nerves of a first trip, then a 4 month old lab pup turned up - owner was nervous about all the loud dogs, but her little pup was soon bounding about with the slightly older dogs. 

Lots of noise and running about, but all good.

Then this lady turned up with her dog. Immediately it dived in between three other dogs rough housing (one mine) and got barked at, then this lady jumped in and grabbed my dog by her collar demanding to know whose dog it was!! I came over, calmed my dog down, then let her go. A minute later this new dog jumped into two different dogs game, got in a mild tussle and this lady waded in again and grabbed a dog she didnt know by the scruff and started demanding to know whose dog it was, the owner came over and cooled things down. Then a minute later her pup got in a third conflict and she waded in and grabbed a dog barking on the sidelines but who wasnt event involved by the scruff demanding to know who the owner was. Then left in a huff.

This is WTF!! Right?

My read on her dog: This pup wasnt aggressive but needed 3 mins to bark and yap to figure out its place in the group there that day and would have been fine, but she kept stopping this from happening, so unhelpful to everyone.

My bigger question, and thankfully this is a hypothetical, if someones going to go around a dog park yanking multiple strange dogs by their necks - if they get bitten whose fault is that? Like, legally. These are mid-size 50-60 lbs dogs shes yanking around, so if thatd happened its not like shed have been nipped by an ankle biter.

If I were to do that and got bit Id 100% blame myself for failing Dog Interactions 101, is this a fair assessment, or am I off base here?

Any tips for dealing with these sorts of folks? My current plan, should I see this person again, is to flatly leave, as dont want to have a very predictable situation to deal with if someone keeps insisting on ambushing dogs at a dog park&",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ott9n/dog_park_etiquette_expectations_and_other_people/

That said, I've been looking into carriers that attach to the body (front-wise, can't use backpacks), but most of them aren't long enough to carry dachshunds of her size. I'm also looking for one that would hold any messes because she tends to pee when she gets excited (new people are her favorite!), and I don't really wish for pee on my lap!

**Note: I do understand how unsanitary/uncomfortable that could potentially be depending on the product, but in the worst-case scenario where there aren't any products perfect for this situation, I would do my darndest to make sure she isn't in there for very long, and bathe her once we got home.**

2023-11-10,1699578036,[Breeds] Looking for some help on finding the right dog to join the family,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First time being the sole owner but have grown up with many family dogs 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference, I see pros and cons to both sides.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Highest on my list of traits would probably be loyal and smart. I would love a dog who greets me when I get home because they missed me or comforts me if Ive had a bad day. But one thats also not afraid to go out and play with other dogs and do their own thing if such a breed exists 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Most recently Ive been very interested in German Pinschers and Black Mouth Curs. What caught my attention on both of them was their loyalty, intelligence, protectiveness, and both strong but sleek looks. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I would like to do the basics like sit, lay down, bed, heel, etc. and would be willing to go beyond that if the breed called for it. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I do not. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work from home for the most part so there is potential for a lot of general interaction with the dog every day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I would say 1 - 2 hours would be consistently achievable. Main form preferable would be taking them into the back yard and playing with them there. My girlfriend takes her dog to a dog park frequently so that would definitely be something I would do as well but not as often as using the back yard 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* ~once a week would be preferred. 
I would be willing to pay for grooming

* between 40 and 70 pounds. Id prefer the upper side of that range 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* As little as possible- shedding and barking I could certainly look past to an extent but slobber a little less so 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* not important 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly when they want to be 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* leaning more towards eager-to-please but occasionally does their own thing 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would definitely like a protector type of dog who would respond to those things. With that being said Id think they would be maybe hesitant to meet someone new but once an introduction is made theyre welcoming 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Chewing furniture or tearing up the house in general would like to be avoided 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. I work from home and my girlfriend (who lives with me) is hybrid. On occasion I do travel for work (maybe 3 times / year) for a few days or a week at a time but other than that they will not be home alone often. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My girlfriend doesnt have preferences and while she would be willing to do anything necessary as far as care goes, I do want the dog to be more attached to me so I would be doing most of the care 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* My girlfriend has a 90lb Doodle and I have two cats currently 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* not at this point, possibly in the future 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I do not 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Atlanta, I am not aware of any laws 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer Id say is typically in the 80s but ventures into the 90s, winters typically 40s that dip into the 20s/30s (Fahrenheit) 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* As mentioned earlier Ive been researching German Pinschers and BMCs recently. German Pinschers are very hard to find and puppies are outrageously expensive which is why I started to look elsewhere. BMCs may require more exercise than I would prefer to provide on a daily basis to avoid tearing up the house due to boredom. They also seem to shed a lot which would like to be avoided but is not a deal breaker. Again, both very intelligent, loyal, strong and sleek, and great sizes. Just hard to find and possibly too high energy which I may not be able to find with the other preferences I have but figured someone may have some ideas. Thank you!

2023-11-09,1699570333,[Breeds] Help us choose our first dog!,"Hi all. My partner and I LOVE dogs and we are looking to get our first one. We filled out the survey and look forward to your recommendations!  Thanks in advance!

**Introduction**

1 Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, this will be our first dog, and we have no idea about training, but we're eager to learn. My partner and I both only owned cats (separately) before.

2 Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* No preference. We like the idea of rescuing, and this will definitely be our choice for our future dogs, but currently, we're ok with going through a breeder to get the breed/age that'll best match us.

3 Describe your ideal dog.

* We need our dog to be comfortable staying at home alone. We also live in an apartment, so we want a dog that is not too vocal. Overall, a laid-back dog that loves to snuggle with us on the couch or play fetch but can also be independent when we're busy working from home.

4 What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Here are our favorites: Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, and Australian Shepherd. We like larger dogs and have always thought these look super cute! We slightly prefer long-haired dogs.

5 What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* No peeing on the floor! Regular sit, stay, and come here would do, but of course we wouldn't mind teaching it a simple trick or two! Most importantly, we want to train our dog to be able to stay home alone for a couple of hours without a problem.

6 Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Nope

**Care Commitments**

7 How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* As long as needed. We can dedicate more time in the puppy stage.

8 How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* We can take the dog for daily walks, and a dog park every now and then. We think around 1h daily, but we are open and willing to increase this time. We won't be doing any running or hiking.

9 How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* For brushing, as much as needed. Yes, we can do everything at home (we'll learn!), but we're also ok with paying a professional to do it about 4 times a year.

**Personal Preferences**

10 What size dog are you looking for?

* Large or medium. No small dogs.

11 How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, but ideally no barking or slobber.

12 How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It's a nice to have but not necessary.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13 Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Somewhere in the middle

14 Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Somewhere in the middle, leaning toward eager to please. It's not a big requirement for us; we're fine with both as long as they're not too independent or too dependent.

15 How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No preference. Just not aggressive.

16 Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, since it's our first dog.

17 Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifestyle**

18 How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Possibly 8h+ at least 3 days a week

19 What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My partner and I will take care of the dog together, and our preferences are matched.

20 Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We don't currently have any and we are not planning to get other pets any time soon. But maybe in the future, we may think about getting another dog as well.

21 Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Nope

22 Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Currently renting but no restriction on the lease. We'll find a suitable place that'll allow our dog if we move.

23 What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Western Canada. Winters in Canada can be harsh but it's a lot better where we live compared to other provinces, so that's not a big worry for us.

24 What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 20 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit) in summer to above 0 Celsius (about 45 Fahrenheit) in winter

**Additional Information and Questions**

25 Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I'm currently in grad school, and my partner has a hybrid work schedule. My current schedule is quite flexible, and I primarily work from home. After graduation, I'll be taking a break, so I can dedicate time for puppy training if needed. However, once I start working full-time, there might be a possibility of a couple of days working from home, but it'll depend.
* Also we don't want our dog to stink!

26 Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-11-09,1699566836,Looking for a breed that is great with kids,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
No, we rescued a dog who ended up being very sick, and unfortunately passed away about nine months after we adopted her. We spent a great deal of time on training during her first few good months, and worked with a trainer weekly for about 10 weeks, so well versed in training (and will work with a trainer again this next time around). We of course spared no penny in trying to get her healthy, her little body just couldn't do it anymore.   
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
This time we'd like to go through a reputable breeder.   
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
Easy-going, patient and tolerant. My son is autistic. He's high functioning, so it doesn't affect him intellectually, but it does affect him socially/emotionally. His mannerisms are different from neurotypical people, in that he can be a bit rigid with his movements and has bursts of energy and sounds. The most important thing to us is finding a breed that won't be nervous around him, and love him for his wonderful quirks. He's a very loving child, so a dog that will snuggle with him would be a bonus.   
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
I've done a lot of research on the best dogs for autistic kids, and golden retrievers and labs always top the list. I just want to make sure I'm not missing another breed that should be on our list.   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
Sit, Stay, Place and good recall. If we happen to hit the jackpot with a dog that could be trained for emotional support for my son, that would be fantastic, but it's not at all a requirement.   
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
No  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
1-2 hours a day.   
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly, and does that include using a dog park?    
With our last dog, we did two 30-45 minute walks a day. Would love a dog that was maybe a little less, 1 walk a day would work, and there might be days where a walk can't happen. We do have a small backyard, and my son and his sister will play with the dog as well. Our last pup was a working dog mix, so we know all the mental stimulation games but definitely know now a working dog is not the right fit for us. My husband and I are both at the office one day a week, so we would take the dog to doggy daycare on that day instead of 9 hours at home. We love our local doggy daycare.   
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
Daily brushing is totally fine, but clipping nails makes me nervous; definitely willing to do monthly trips to a professional. We did with our last dog.   
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
Small to medium  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
Can handle shedding. Less vocal would be nice. Slobber is fine!   
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
We have a small fenced-in area, that is really best for potty breaks and fetch (it's long, but not too wide). However, we have a huge backyard that, due to terrain, is not able to be fenced in. Would love to be able to go out to that area and play off-leash.   
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
Really right down the middle. Definitely want a dog that likes to snuggle, will sleep in the bed with my kids, but one that is also ok to have personal space and alone time.   
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager to please?  
Eager-to-please  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
We'd prefer a dog that loves all strangers and greets them happily. Definitely not looking for a dog that guards the house. We have other families and kids over often.   
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
I know how difficult this is for friends of ours, and honestly, no. Given the need to take the dog to doggy daycare, we want it to like other dogs.   
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
Not really a behavior, but a breed that is known to be highly anxious is not a right fit for us. Also, since we have kids and they do lots of sports, a dog that has separation anxiety is probably not a fit for us, as it will need to stay home alone for 2-3 hours a couple of times a week.   
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
At most 3-4 hours at a time. We work from home most days, and the day we don't, we'll do doggy daycare. But there will be weekend events where they'll need to be home alone for a bit of time.   
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
My husband wants a dog that is good on a leash, as he loves to go for walks. He'll handle most of those. My kids want a dog that snuggles and kisses them, and will sleep with them. They will help with feeding and training.   
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
No  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
Yes, almost 100% of the time, except when they are at school. My children are 11 and 8.   
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
No  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
Atlanta, and our neighborhood HOA does ban pit bulls.   
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
Summer can get up to the high 90s, winter is around the 40s.

Weve been talking about this for three years so please dont think this was a hasty decision! The timing is just right. 

Im a little nervous because when we get her next week, she will already be 16 weeks old. She was supposed to have a family come pick her up a few weeks ago and they completely ghosted her, never showed up =- my heart hurts thinking about her being left all alone as a baby as her siblings were taken because someone changed their mind. 

Ive done lots of research and I know that her being 16 weeks is going to be trickier as far as fear and socialization. We could continue looking for a younger puppy and make our lives easier (I guess), but she is already our baby in our minds. Im absolutely planning on getting her fully vaxxed ASAP so we can socialize her immediately (going to pre-schedule that tomorrow). What other things can I do to acclimate her and make her not fearful of the world? I definitely want to get her in puppy play groups and training too. Will she bond with us and love us even though shes older?

2023-11-09,1699551221,My family wants to give our dog away,"So just to explain the situation a bit:

We've previoulsy had a dog (W. Highland terrier) for 12 years before she passed away. A few months later my sister and the parents bring home a new puppy (M, Bichon). He's just the sweetest dog you will ever meet. He's always happy and wants to play/cuddle all the time. He adores people and wants to be petted even when meeting them for the first time.  
But the problem is that he's very destructive. We've had him for abt a year now and also had him castrated, since lots of people told us it helps with these things. Well, it didn't really change anything - he still goes around the flat peeing on the sofa, table, beds, etc. He's also torn apart the corners of the sofa.   
We've bought him a large cage for when none of us is home and it obviously helps, but we all feel sad about him having to be inside... and he hasn't learned that doing bad stuff will land him in a cage.  
Now my mom says she can't deal with the trouble any more, because it's also a big financial burden having so many things destroyed. She says she will give him away. Ofcourse we're all extremely sad about that (my mom included) because we love him and he adores us, but I can't say I don't see where's she's coming from.  
He's a bit over 1 yr old now and I feel it would be really bad for him if he would have to change his environment and family suddenly.  


Do you guys have any similar experiences or tips?

We had to do a month long road trip in a rented van to wait for the right conditions to get him a flight.  (As an aside, anyone that knows of a reliable dog shipper, or an airline other than American that puts dogs into the cargo bay, or even better-- how to get a medium sized dog into Coach....)

He's just over a year old.  An Aussie mix.  His mother looked nothing like him.  Don't see any other dogs that look at all like him.

At dog parks, he's not all that interested in other dogs.  It is a ""sometimes"" thing.

He has a real calming effect on neurotic dogs that bark all the time.  He just quietly sits on his side of the fence and they eventually stop (usually).

He likes to chase the ball, but refuses to give it up so it can be thrown again.  He likes to ""argue"" about who has the ball.

He'll sometimes play ""tug"" but loses interest in a few minutes.

He doesn't want to go outside.  We have to coax him.

He travels very well.  New environments (about 15 in 60 days) don't seem to bug him.  (He didn't like the ocean the first time he saw it, but last week and yesterday was happy to look at it.)

He loves being petted.

We did a lot of walks on that trip.  one to two hours a day.  He was quite engaged with the smelling.

All this ""good stuff"" to then ask why he sometimes gets a 1000 yard stare.

He's lying on the floor right now (he has many other options) with his eyes wide open, looking at nothing.

We can't let him 'nibble on us' or 'jump on us'.  I have lots of ""war wounds"".  He's excited and having fun, but jeez, drawing blood just doesn't work for us.

We're going to take him to the local brewery tonight.  He's usually enjoyed all the places we stopped at.

But that 1000-yard-stare just breaks my heart.

He never has weight issues and can eat a lot. Sometimes if he goes through a food-finicky stage, it becomes a challenge keeping weight on him. He doesn't seem to have any reactions to grains and is on a regulated gastrointestinal wet food diet. His only real tummy issue tends to be high-fat food (either human food or dog treats) upsetting his stomach. 

He's a super picky eater but goes wild for sweets. He absolutely loves them. He's sneaked into the oreos before (to my horror). I've given him a lick of whipped cream or a lick of vanilla ice cream, but they're both too high-fat for his tummy in the long run. 

I've tried appealing to his sweet tooth by making him lightly sweetened honey + PB dog treats with applesauce and he had no interest at all. I think they're too bland/not sweet enough. And also he really loves vanilla flavor. 

I'd like to make him something sweeter but dog-safe. Would it be better to use sugar or more honey? If my dog has no weight issues, is there anything actually wrong with making him some dog-safe sugary vanilla wafers as a treat for his serious sweet tooth? Am I putting him at any other risk?

[https://www.caninefoundations.com/meet-our-trainers/](https://www.caninefoundations.com/meet-our-trainers/) Her name is Lisa large and she is around 1 hour away!

[https://www.tailwindstraining.com/our-team](https://www.tailwindstraining.com/our-team) her name is Shianna and she is around 40 mins away!

So my question would be if those trainers are good! The Tailwinds one is closer, but I think the Canine Foundations website looks more promising! I know I found the ones that were linked but I would also love to know if I'm on the right track with finding trainers or if you have any other tips, because I would love to find more just in case if those ones don't work out!

I also wanted to ask about vet behaviorists! I'm very new to this and I'm not sure what they would do! Why would I need one? This question you don't have to answer since its kinda dumb! lol!

And if anyone reads the OG post I linked, and maybe wants to let me know more about her fear that would be great! I'm still confused if she if reactive or not!

We moved from the Midwest to Boston a few months back, and the walking area around our new apartment complex uses mulch on and around the landscaping. He was not interested in the mulch at first, only smelling it and moving on, but over the last 2-3 months we noticed that he actually munches on it, and the wooden pellets do come out in his poop regularly. Some of the pieces can be even up to an inch long, so we are worried that it might perforate his intestines. He knows ""drop"" and we are trying to watch him during walks, but since his head is almost always to the ground, and the mulch is everywhere, we would have to keep a non-stop look on him, so it's not the best solution. 

We thought it might be pica, but not sure if it can just randomly start manifesting like that, and he doesn't really eat any other weird stuff, only a random rabbit dropping every now and then, and maybe a fresh post-rain mushroom once in a while, but that's it.

2023-11-09,1699502709,Are dog adoption fees ever going to decrease?,"So peak pandemic when everyone was getting a dog, prices for dogs of all stripes skyrocketed, everything from adoption fees for local shelters to ethically bred puppies. Now that were a couple years out, the shelters are filling up again&but costs are still high. (For dogs. Cats of indeterminate background are still adoptable for around $25 where I live.) Will prices ever go down? Did covid just hasten a trend that was already happening?

Heres my possible causes list as I consider this:

 * A good dog is more expensive to produce. A generation ago, a lot of health and genetic tests just werent available, but now they are considered de rigueur for ethical breeders, adding to their costs. 

 * Vet costs are up, so (a) the relative cost of buying a dog vs the cost one spends on vet fees makes a more expensive dog seem reasonable and  (b)
The vet costs shelters and breeder endure must be passed on to potential adopters. 

 * Demand is just still high compared to supply. Spay and neuter campaigns were effective, so populations are down, especially in Northern/urban/ affluent areas. Fewer adoptable shelter dogs impacts costs of bred dogs. 

 * As fur parent culture takes off, people tie their identity more to their pets than a generation ago, so instead of/ in addition to spending money on the right car or the right handbag, people are willing to go to great lengths for that red doodle (suburban) or French Bulldog (urban) that completes their lifestyle or aesthetic. 

 * Relatedly, if youre planning that every year you will be spending $8-9k on dog walkers, premium dog food, vet visits (discussed above), and all those new-fangled products like petTV or GPS collars, an upfront cost of half that might not seem so burdensome.  

 * If the last two bullet points seem to be talking about the very rich dog owners, that might be the segment that is driving the increase. With the widening wealth gap, one segment of the population has money to burn while another does not. Shelters and breeders can have policies that already favor the rich (like insisting you own rather than rent, having someone at home during the day, or have a fenced backyard), but also they dont care about the SES equity of who adopts their dogs. If they place all their dogs in loving rich homes, they will be just as happy, even if that means less well off people cant afford a dog at all. 

 * Shelters and breeders are charging what they can. People got used to seeing $500 to adopt an adult dog, so why suddenly drop to $400 or $300? Just as gas prices spike up in a crisis and slowly decrease, it will take time and competition for prices to lower to pre-pandemic levels. 

 * Since dogs are the new children for Millennials, spending $4-6k on a new puppy is still cheaper than having a kid. In other words, the price isnt compared to what dogs cost 10 years ago, but against the cost of a child. 

What do you think? Why are costs so high and will they ever go down again?",dogs,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17r4lof/are_dog_adoption_fees_ever_going_to_decrease/
2023-11-09,1699513065,"Is ""mouthing"" behavior bad?","I'm very new to owning a dog; we just adopted our Dahlia a few weeks ago. I'm 31 and I've owned cats my entire life but never a dog! So this is all very new to me. Dahlia is 3 years old, the shelter called her a retriever/heeler mix but who knows (we have a genetic test on the way because I'm curious), about 35 pounds. She's generally a sweetheart with some separation anxiety issues that we're working through.

I've observed since we adopted her that Dahlia will sometimes mouth at my hand and arm when I'm playing with her/petting her and she gets excited. She is *extremely* gentle; it startled me the first time she did it but it never comes close to biting. It's like the amount of force you'd use if you were trying to hold an egg between your teeth lol. Honestly I've found it to be very sweet and affectionate, like obviously she could bite harder if she wanted but she's so delicate with me.

I was curious as to *why* she does it and I went to look it up but all I've found were a ton of pages on how to train a dog out of that behavior. Most of those pages emphasize showing the dog that they're hurting you, which, well, she isn't! If she was actually biting with any level of force of course I'd be working on getting that trained out of her immediately but she just isn't.

I guess what I'm asking is, is it wrong for me to allow her to continue this behavior? Is it something that's liable to escalate into actual biting in the future if I don't stop her from doing it now? Or is it overall harmless and something that can be ignored?

2023-11-09,1699513251,Teach Dog to Use Stairs for Furniture - Help!,"Hello! So, to get right to it, my dog is an 11 year old pit bull type (probably - no papers, so best guess) with arthritis. I've had her since she was two, and she's always been allowed on the bed and the couch. She's a huge cuddle bug, and she gets really excited about going to bed because it means she gets to snuggle up with me, and with my partner when she stays over. Bedtime is one of her favorite things.

However, she can't get up on the bed anymore.  I just got new bedroom furniture and my bed is now three feet off the floor; even before this, though, when my bed was pretty low, she was starting to struggle to get on the bed. She also hates being lifted onto the bed; she wants to BE on the bed, but as soon as she thinks she's about to be picked up she's off and trying to escape.

The logical solution, I thought, was to get her some stairs for the bed. They came in recently, and I figured they would be an adjustment, but she is actively scared and stressed by them. They're heavy-duty foam rated for 60 pounds (she's 50 pounds) and attach to the bed so they're pretty stable as far as I can tell, but maybe they don't feel stable to her? I've been trying to teach her how to use them, and she grips them with her claws like her life depends on it and won't move. I've been showing her how to walk up them, but each session is very stressful for her; she hides in her crate after every time we try it, which she usually only does when she's trying to escape bath time.

Should I maybe get new stairs that are wood instead of foam? The foam seems stable to me, but I also don't have to use them. Or should I keep working with her until she gets used to them? The stairs are very new, so we haven't done a lot of work with them, and it might be too early to call it an issue.",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17r7b6a/teach_dog_to_use_stairs_for_furniture_help/
2023-11-09,1699514016,"My neighbour gave me her dog, I've never owned a dog before, what should I absolutely know?","To start this I will say that it was a thought out decision to take Daemon in, as my neighbour gave birth and wouldn't have been allowed to keep him by the social worker. This is in no part due to the dog's behaviour but because of his breed. He is a mixed breed but the vet has him down as mostly Dogo Argentino with some Pitbull in him and a smidge of lab, not an idea mix for a first time owner but I have been walking him and occasionally taking him home for the day for weeks and we've developed a bond.
He's a big boy at about 45 kilos and given that I myself weigh in at 40 kilos and 5 feet tall it is a bit of a comical sight but he is very eager to please. He is an adult as he is three but he still has very puppy like behaviour on walks and has very high energy needs, which I am aware of and don't mind as I am an active person myself.
Here's some of the concerns I have: I'm a cat person and don't know much about what a dog needs to be fulfilled beyond being thoroughly exercised, fed, and mentally stimulated with tasks and lick mats and such. 
Daemon is also having chronic leash pulling issues, he wears a harness because of his size but it remains difficult to get him to walk slowly and not run towards the off leash area and drag me with him on the first walk of the day. I can control him but he easily forgets himself and I would like some help with that. 
I also have three cats but he comes from a house with a cat and has never shown anything but mild annoyance even when one of mine landed on his head while playing.
A last concern I have is perhaps a bit strange but he doesn't defend himself, the other day my friend's chihuahua came over and barked at him because he had a treat and he dropped it! I would have expected him to at least eat faster or side eye the little creature but he didn't. He also refuses to eat unless I pick up the bowl and hand feed him the first bite, I don't mind but it is odd that he would just let himself starve otherwise, he sure gobbles it down afterwards.

For gear I have a harness, a heavy duty leash with a waist belt for extra precautions, he has a dog bed and a few toys and I feed him Edgar and Cooper dry food with some occasional wet food and cooked meat. It's a budget because he eats like three kilos a day but he seems more energetic on this.

Oh, and he has very good recall but I have only let him off leash in a fenced in area, he's good with other dogs but does try to play with them. Can I let him off leash on hikes given that he always comes running whenever called? Or are there other precautions to take?

2023-11-09,1699517462,I feel so frustrated with people,"Sometimes I really wish that it was illegal to breeds dogs. That only select people could breed and they are closely monitored. And bothe the breeders and the dogs have to go through thourough testing. That if anyone breeds their dogs (on purpose) without authorization would be disciplined. As well as people who buy from unauthorized breeders.

I'm all for *ethical and responsible* breeding to keep the breed alive. But lately I've been coming across people who are purposefully breeding their dogs who are often different breeds because they're in love =>p=.....=. 

Or there's the crossbreeding to get the ""hypoallergenic coat and zero shedding"" which if people did the littlest amount of research would mean hypoallergenic means they produce *less* allergens, not non. And there is no ""zero shedding"" dog.

Or special coats. Merle anything that doesn't originally have merle (/dapple/harlequin). Or longhaired dogs that were originally short haired (some exceptions). Or shrinking/enlarging breeding causing them to be deformed.

I'm honestly getting so tired of seeing ignorant people breeding for 0 reason other than money, their dogs are ""in love"", or just because they want to. And you can't just try to publicly call them out because they are so stubborn and so set in their ways it makes you feel like you're talking to a rock. 

I know BYBs aren't going to slow down at all in my lifetime and possibly many more after, and me writing this has the same effect as screaming into a void. But one can hope, am I right?

I'm so close to just wanting to delete all my social media accounts so I no longer see poorly produced dogs.",dogs,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17r899i/i_feel_so_frustrated_with_people/

2023-11-09,1699503476,Tips on how to stop jumping and biting?,"My family adopted a Hovawart puppy this summer, who is now a little over 6 months old, and he's a very over excited puppy.

Whenever someone enters, or even if you (who lives there) enter the room, he will often (almost everytime) jump up on you and/or bite and pull at your clothes.

I know he's doing it out of pure excitement, and I've read that if that happens, you shouldn't give the dog any attention when its happening. Don't look, don't touch and stand still untill he stops.

But it's hard to do sometimes since he is such a big puppy, that when he stands on his 2 legs he is almost as ""tall"" as you. 

So my question is pretty broad, but do you have advice or experiences with this?

I'm hoping for any good recommendations on dog beds. My dog doesn't lick the bed or chew it up anymore but does sleep alot since she's older. I am trying to find a new bed to buy for her that is more durable with the fabric. The last couple of beds I have bought when I go to unzip the bed to wash the cover, when I put it back together the zipper keeps ripping off and the there is just an opening on the one end where my dog can get under the fabric since it seems the quality of the zipper area is horrible.

2023-11-09,1699538553,Applying Eye Ointment,"Hi everyone - my dog currently has a meibomian cyst that is both on top of and underneath her top eyelid. We have been given a steroid ointment to use for 7-10 days along with some warm compressing to encourage it to rupture. If it doesnt resolve in this time we need to have it surgically removed since its under the lid.

I CANNOT for the life of me do this. I am extremely squeamish about eyes (I cant even wear contacts myself). When the vet showed me the cyst under her eye I had to sit down because I got light headed and almost passed out.

Im at a loss of what to do to get this ointment in her eye properly. She can totally tell Im anxious and is jerking all over the place when I try to put it in. Im so freaked to have to go so close to her eye and Im so worried Ill hit it with the applicator by accident. 

Does anyone have any tips or suggestions?

2023-11-09,1699537547,I just dont know what to do anymore :(,"I need support, advice, idk really anything because I dont know what to do.

So to give you backstory, when I got my girl last year August I was married, we had split schedules so she wasnt alone for more than 2-3 hours at a time, we were living in AZ in a first floor exterior facing apartment surrounded by other dog owners so it was safe to let her out in the yard, we were all respectful and took turns.

My life has taken a total 180 and so has hers. I lost my dad so I moved back home to MI to a second story interior facing apartment, my husband and I are getting divorced and hes already moved to TX and she is not dealing with me still having to work very well. Ive been working 4 hours, coming home for a potty break, then working the last 4 hours.

On the 19th I left the (screened) windows open and she ripped the screen and escaped. It took TEN DAYS to find her, and two days later she OPENED THE WINDOW to try again. The leasing office got ahold of me and I got home in time to destroy my screen further and save her. My parents gave me my old dogs crate to train her and keep her safe while Im working, but we didnt have enough time to train for me to feel comfy leaving her all day this week.

Well, Monday I came home to a trashed apartment. I locked all the windows so she cant open them, which resulted in my tv being destroyed as well as pretty much all of my sentimental glass pieces I was displaying :( I crated her the next day, still following the 4 hours, potty break, 4 hours schedule. Yesterday it took over 30 minutes of begging and pleading before she went in and laid down while I was crying on the phone to my mom. Today after 45 minutes she just wouldnt budge. Not for all the treats, her favorite toy, stinky food, nothing so I had to take her to my moms.

I just dont know what to do at this point. I cant take her to my moms every day, my mom is disabled and cant take care of a 55-60lb German shepherd mix. I cant NOT go to work and as hard as Ive tried I cant find anything remote that I qualify for that will pay me even close to what Im earning now! I cant keep her safe, I cant afford to fix her if she gets hurt much less replace what she is destroying, I cant afford doggy daycare, I mean I went from a DINK to a single income taking care of 3 animals!

Honestly Im at the point where for her own safety, and Im not going to lie my mental health which is already limping along and getting worse by the day, Im considering rehoming her. On Monday I came home just wanting to cry and forget about my existence and my place was trashed, Im doing everything I can but I still keep failing her, I just cant keep doing this.",dogs,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17rd9qb/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

2023-11-09,1699519736,"Breed for Cats, Townhouse, and Walks","\*\*Hi, I am here asking for advice on my first dog in a townhouse situation.\*\*  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* This will be my first dog as an adult.  I grew up with Miniature Dachshunds as a young child, and as a teen, I lived with an Australian Shepherd and a Bichon Frise/Shih Tzu mix.  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder.  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* My ideal dog would get along with cats, like to go on 30-60 minute walks, and be a quieter dog as I live in a townhouse.  I want a medium or smaller dog that is easy to train, specifically with potty training.  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* Shelties because they are pretty and do well with training, but I am worried about the noise level.  Whippets because they seem to be a sturdy dog that meets most of my expectations, but I am worried about them with cats.  Italian Greyhounds because they meet my requirements and look goofy in a good way, but I am worried about their tiny legs around cats and stairs.  I am not married to the idea of any of these dogs though.  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* I would like to train my dog to do basic obedience and potentially go through agility training.  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* I would like to agility train, but I am not committed to competition.  I have no experience with this.  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* Including walks, maybe 2-3 hours.  I can do more or less, but regularly that's what I can commit.  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* I can definitely exercise a dog for half an hour each day, and I can go up to an hour.  I am hoping to do walks since we live in a walkable neighborhood and have a dog-friendly nature center a few minutes away.  Toys as well, but I am hoping to do most exercise through walks as I am working towards completing a 5k.  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* I am willing to brush weekly as well as trim nails when necessary, and I am willing and able to pay to have a dog groomed professionally.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* Medium or small  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* Any amount of shedding is fine.  Minimal barking is preferred; I know all dogs bark sometimes, but less is better.  Extremely minimal amounts of slobber are okay.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* Not important.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* Snuggly  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\* I'm leaning towards eager-to-please.  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* I want visitors and strangers to have a positive greeting.  I would prefer minimal barking when someone knocks on my door or enters my yard, but I do not mind excitability.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* I do not think I have the skills to do this.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\* Any aggression towards cats or small animals.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* One person in the household works from home, so the dog will only be left alone if we are on vacation (rare lol) or doing a day trip.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* I live with my fiance who wants a quieter dog that can handle being with our cats.  I will be the primary caregiver for the dog, but they will help when needed.  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* We have 3 cats.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* No, but there are children in the neighborhood.  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\* Nope, no renting here.  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\* No breed bans where I am at.  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\* Summer is 70s/80s, and the winter is 20s/30s. Fahrenheit.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
\* There are stairs in our townhouse that have open backs (I don't know the terminology), so that has been worrying me a little bit.  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-11-08,1699483616,Trying to find the right breed,"Introduction
1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
*Its MY first dog but my family owned a dog (Puggle)  growing up I was a main caretaker for. I lived with 2 lab mixes for 2 years that I fed, gave meds, picked up after, let out, took on walks, etc. The main thing I didnt do was buy their food or cover their vet bills since they belonged to my roommate/cousin.
2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
*I would prefer to go through a breeder, mainly so I know their history and that they are healthy.
3) Describe your ideal dog.
*Couch potato, cuddly, enjoys short walks (20-30 minutes). Social with people and dogs. Comfortable with apartment living.
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
*I love the personality and look of CKCS and Frenchies but because of their health issues Id feel terrible getting one. Ive been looking into Havanese based on other recommendation posts but curious to hear what other breeds Im overlooking that might be a good fit. 
5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
*Basic sit and stay. Would appreciate it if they can grasp heel and basic recall but not super important to me. If they are able to learn other commands that would be amazing but not essential. 
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
*No
Care Commitments
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
*When Im not at work I am a homebody and love to spend my time relaxing at home. Im happy to spend time playing and will train as much as necessary to get the basic commands understood and keep their mind engaged.
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
*I like to go on short walks after work, about 20-30 minutes. I like going to the dog park with my cousin and her dogs so if thats an environment my dog feels comfortable in I would bring them every week or 2 in the warmer months and they would probably get time in a fenced yard to run to their heart's content at least once a week.
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
*Im happy to brush every day if necessary as well as any regular maintenance. I also am comfortable paying to have grooming done regularly.
Personal Preferences
10) What size dog are you looking for?
*Small, or on the smaller side of medium. But I live in an apartment (800 sq. ft) and dont want a dog to be too big for that amount of space. I want them to feel comfortable and not overly confined.
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
*Low shedding is preferred, but Im also not unfamiliar with being covered in dog hair. Minimal barking because I live in an apartment but Ive also lived with very chatty labs that never bothered me much. Im not big on slobber but if everything else is perfect about a dog its not a deal breaker.
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
*Its not important to me, I cant imagine many scenarios they would intentionally be in that situation. 
Dog Personality and Behavior
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
*I love snuggles, so would prefer a dog who wants to cuddle up at least most of the time. Our dog growing up was very cuddly but liked her personal space too and would take herself to her kennel so Im fine with a similar personality.
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?
*I lean more towards eager-to-please but same as above Im fine with wanting their own space. As long as they arent outwardly defiant Im happy. 
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
*An alert bark is fine if someone knocks on the door. I dont want them losing their mind every time they hear someone walk by the apartment door or window because I live in a main level unit so theres a lot of foot traffic.
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
*Of course, obviously not seeking out a dog like that but not everyone is a people person, and not every dog likes being around other dogs. 
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?
*No.
Lifestyle
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
*I work in the office 3 days a week so Im gone from 7:30 am- 5 (no later than 5:30). Im hoping to move closer to the office so I can at least come home on lunch to give the dog a potty break. I live alone but I have family nearby, both with and without dogs, that will take my dog anytime I would need to be away any longer than that.
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
*None.
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
*No.
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
*Probably not, maybe the occasional interaction once my friends start having kids in the next couple years.
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
*I rent, planning to move to a house in a few years. All small breeds are fine.
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
*Kansas City, no banning on breeds in my area in the size I want.
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
*Summer 85, Winter 45",dogs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qy0zk/trying_to_find_the_right_breed/
2023-11-08,1699475848,[Breeds] Help narrow my rescue dog search!,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* This will be the first dog my wife and I own as \*our\* dog. I've had several dogs in the past, mostly Lab mixes, but I was a child/teen so my parents handled most of the training and care. We currently own a 5 year old Husky.   
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* Rescue dogs for sure, been checking local shelters the past two weeks and have reached out to one or two for more info.   
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* My ideal dog would be one that sticks to me like velcro. Above all else, I want a dog for a companion, a dog that loves to be around me and getting smothered with affection. Our Husky is the opposite of that and really only likes to be in the same room, not get all touchy. A low-medium energy level would be ideal since I enjoy going out for walks around our apartment and there are two dog parks within 10 minutes of home, so exercise is more a nice chance to get out of the house than a chore. That being said, once play time is over and night is falling, I want a dog that's going to curl up on the couch with me and cuddle while I does off with my wife watching TV or reading lol.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I'm not very picky about breeds besides super high energy ones which I know won't be a good fit. (the husky wasn't my idea but I meet his needs as best I can anyway, fortunately he's fairly lazy as far as huskies go.) I'm most familiar with Labradors so that'd be nice, beautiful and sweet dogs, easy to find mixes in shelters too. Anything else is fair game, I care much more about individual personality than looks or a specific breed. (plus I'm rescuing so let's be real, it'll be 80% pits, 15% labs, 5% everything else.)   
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* I definitely want to do your basics, recall, sit, stay, come, wait, etc. Fetching is really fun and a low effort way to tire a pooch out. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake but not required.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* Nope! Closest thing to work he'll do is dig a hole at the garden I work at.   
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* On a work day, after all chores and responsibilities are done? I've got a solid 4-5 hours free, so I'm happy to spend anywhere from 30 minutes to an 2 hours between playing and training (cuddle time is unlimited haha), just depends on how me and the dog are feeling. Weekends I usually don't do much but tend to wake up early so we could go kill an hour or two at the dog park with our other dog easy.   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* I can go up to an hour and a half/2 hours, but I'd like to keep it to 30min-1hr if I can. I prefer lower energy to higher, I tend to work in bursts. Lots of walks around the apartment complex everyday, playtime inside like tug of war, fetch, etc, a trip to the dog park if we can make it in time.   
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I don't mind weekly brushing, I've got enough of that with the husky. Less is better but I'm already eating hair with every meal anyway, so I won't notice the extra.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* I grew up with medium to large dogs so that's what I tend to prefer. Anything 15lbs-80lbs is a nice range. Not concrete though.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Shedding is whatever, slobber isn't ideal but it ain't gonna kill me, I live in an apartment so some barking is okay when playing or something but I don't want a noise complaint.   
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* Obviously that'd be fantastic but not required. It'd be nice to I could bring the dog to work, otherwise my apartment requires a leash as do public areas, and dog parks in town are fenced.   
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* SNUGGLY! Our husky hates being hugged and pet a lot and I've never felt so disliked by a dog in my life!   
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* Eager to please, please!   
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I'd like the dog to be indifferent at best and watchful but quiet at worst. I'd like them to be happy to see them and maybe go up to them for a sniff and pet.   
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* Yes but that's not ideal obviously. The more we can do I public the better.   
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* Nothing really besides being aggressive or super vocal.   
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* Next to never. I work 9 hours a day and my wife stays home. The only time they would ever be completely alone is if we had a date night, so maybe 3 to 4 hours?   
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* My wife's preferences are pretty much the same as mine. I will be the main caretaker but she's happy to do feeding and walking for me, as well as play time.   
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* Yes, one 5 year old Husky.   
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No but kids do get off the bus when I'm getting home sometimes.   
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* Yes I rent, no restrictions at our current place. Around here the typical restrictions are pitbulls, Dobermans, Rottweilers, you get the idea.   
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Sumter, South Carolina. Yes I am.   
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* Summer it's about 75-85, sometimes low 90s. Winter is around 30-50.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
\* We're open to any currently looking at a few senior dogs as well. Ideally the dog will be at least 2 years old to skip the puppy stage.

2023-11-08,1699473580,Best Dog for Obedience?,"Best dog for me for obedience 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, Ive had a German Shepherd before and I currently own a chow chow and a disabled pomeranian. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Reputable breeder 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Medium or small sized with a disposition for learning commands. My German Shepherd was as smart as a whip; she wanted to learn. My chow has zero drive to learn anything due to her stubbornness. My pomeranian is not capable of learning due to his disability. I miss my German Shepherd that was smart as a whip and ready and willing to learn anything. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Im not really sure which is why Im posting. I know German Shepherds have drive but theyre bigger than I necessarily want. Australian Shepherds I know have drive. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Obedience, but more than sit and lay down. I want them to learn spin, play dead, get a specific toy by name and bring it to me, I want them to learn off leash walking, stay, come, jump, leave it, look, etc.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-3 hours daily, it varies. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I have a large fenced in yard and a park (not a dog park but dogs are welcome) down the street from me. Mental stimulation toys like puzzles as well. I can walk him or her once a day for at least an hour. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Im the dog groomer for my family and friends. Grooming and brushing is no issue for me. I do prefer dogs with medium or long hair - the slick super short coated dogs arent my favorite like chihuahuas, pit bulls, or blue heelers for example. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium preferably, or small. Not large or extra large. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Some shedding, some or low barking, NO drool. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Its not incredibly important but since I do want a dog I can train I do want them to learn to be off leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eagar to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I dont really care. My chow is very suspicious of people so Im used to having an aloof dog. I do like how my pomeranian is a friend of the world but it doesnt really matter. She or he will be out with me more in public so maybe not a dog that is super unfriendly. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Nope. I have dogs. I cant have a dog that is aggressive to dogs. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I own one cat and rabbits. Dog must get along with or at least ignore them. Of course this is something I can and will train them to do. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

6 hours a week or so. Im home 99% of the time 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Just me. My friend does come over almost daily and she cant tolerate drool either. Besides that she doesnt care obviously. She will likely help train and walk the dog but ultimately the dog is mine and is my responsibility. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Yes I have a chow, a disabled pomeranian, a cat, and rabbits. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No but at the park there will be kids. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

None

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

USA, Missouri 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Missouri is a bitch. It's hot and its cold. It can be 50F one day and 70F the next. Summers are around 90F in the hottest month or so, winters are 25F in its lowest but it really fluctuates. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I have health issues. I have good days and bad days. I need a dog that could skip a walk or two if it had too - again I do have a large fenced in yard and mental stimulation for him or her.

Just looking for help with my nearly 2 year old dog and I suppose a little bit of reassurance! So she absolutely loves other dogs and humans and one issue she has is that when we are going past another dog in the street she will try to pull over to them to say hello. However, we avoid all on lead greetings unless it is a dog she knows well. She will pull over most of the time and I can manage this just by redirecting her gently, however I would say about once a month (its very inconsistent) she will let out a few barks at a dog if she is feeling particularly frustrated. In the past I have dealt with this by basically in the lead up to getting near the dog either hand feeding her or scattering treats as we approach and this leads to her walking past the dog without any reaction.

I suppose I have a few questions.

a)is this all something to be super worried about?
b) is it common?
c) is the way I have dealt with it in the past been rubbish and would you suggest a particular training routine that might help?

I have 3 dogs. My latest addition is highly energetic pittie youngster. I am looking for recommendation for good surface to put in the section of my backyard that would tolerate their play and bathroom habits. Most of my yard is paved, but there is a section that is currently just dirt. I let the dogs in the yard in between walks, but they bring all the dirt in the house and I have no time hosing them since they go out in the yard frequently. Initially, I was thinking about putting the grass, but they use that area as bathroom, so I am thinking urine would probably destroy the grass. Now I am thinking putting small stone pebbles, but I am wondering if that would create still lots of dirt and dust that they would bring home. This would be my second estethically ranked option after grass. Finally, synthetic turf, which would maybe tolerate abuse the best and be dustless, but I dont like the look of the turf. Is turf porous to let the urine go through? I am ok with them using that section of the yard for bathroom, it is unavoidable. I am fine cleaning after them every few days and spraying the surface with the water hose. I need to cut down the amount of dirt they bring in because I dont have time to wash them every time I let them out. Please, share your experience.

2023-11-08,1699462188,Need Advice about Dog Relocation,"We just relocated our dog last monday, he kept crying when we did, he wasn't going in his cage much either and is just digging holes on the ground to lay on them. He's also apparently sleeping on dirt even though he has a cage. Is there anything I can do to make him used to this location? We moved him here so he can poo and pee without our help sinde the backyard has dirt. His old location was just in front of our kitchen door where people are always Hangin out.

I don't know if he has separation anxiety or is depressed but we relocated him so he can have more time outside. His old location was also just inside the cage with us frequently taking him out.

Edit: i dont get the hate or the bad stuff over my post. My friend's dogs are leashed outside of their house and has no problem with it. Their dogs are also in good shape. I just tried what my friend did and I don't know how to keep my dog used to it. I also have a couple of friends who own dogs and leash them outside. Maybe because you guys are not used to it? But here in southeast asia, leashed and chained dogs are normal, as well as caged, they're in every neighborhood.

Edit 2: I'm sorry if my post does not have much clarification, I'm very bad at explaining at one post, either i forget everything or just forget some details that i didn't know were important. I'm sorry for those who think that I'm neglecting my dog but I do not, I visit him frequently even though I have work, he always gets  enough play time esp fetch, thank you for those who understood my post and asked for clarification before jumping into conclusions.

2023-11-08,1699463235,Adding a second dog,"For those who have 2 dogs- how did you know when it was the right time to add a second? I have a 4-year old female wirehair pointer. She is my first ever dog and I got her when she was a puppy. She was a lot as a puppy but now I love her more than anything. We go on lots of hikes, camping, backpacking. She comes skiing and biking with me. She is independent and stubborn at times but she's mostly a well behaved dog. I did a ton of training with her when she was a puppy. I have been debating getting a second dog for almost 2 years now. We had a trial with another wirehair pointer 2 years ago but he and my current dog ganged up on my cat (17 years old) so it didn't work out. I started fostering in August with the idea of trialing how adding a second dog would be while also helping with the shelter crisis. 

I've fostered about 5 dogs now and my current dog has seemed to really enjoy having another dog around. She loved my last foster but he was not good with cats and had the same stubborn, independent streak my current dog has. My current foster is a 6 month old wirehair mix. I think he might be a good balance with my current dog- he's very food motivated, people focused and eager to please. I've had him a little over a week and he's picked up on so many things. Training him has seemed like a breeze comparatively to my current dog when she was that age. My current dog plays with him but does end up correcting him a lot. He's also super cuddly- I love this little guy and can't imagine him going to another home. 

As much as I want a second dog and love the current foster I have, I can't help but wonder if I'll regret giving up the simplicity of having one dog. At the same time, I've been contemplating adding a second for a while now, so I don't know if that desire is going to go away. I imagine it might never feel like the most practical choice to get a second dog.

Now, I understand the ""don't rely on ingredients list"" statement, because there is a lot of manipulation and marketing, but how can this list be justified as premium product when the first ingredient is maize (even after splitting it into three ingredients), the second is rice and the third is dehydrated poultry protein?  
  
Seems to me that even if I don't understand the ingredients list entirely, at least the first one should be real meat and not maize, no? Otherwise, what's the point of having meat protein? Corn is so cheap that it doesn't make sense to produce something else.  
  
I would appreciate your help.

2023-11-08,1699453474,Please help I accidentally kicked my former abused dog what can I do in this situation,"Please help what can I do in this situation I had adopted a former abused dog he had been with me for 3 years it took a really long time for him to no longer be scared of me or my family and we had earned his trust. He never once shown his behaviors as when he first came in and he can interact with other dogs and humans fine now but yesterday I was watching soccer with my dad and I was very excited when the team won and I accidentally kicked my dog in the back leg. He made a yelp and ran hidden underneath the kitchen table shaking. He wouldnt leave the spot my dad told me its better for me to leave until he calms down but he wont even touch my dad or any of my family or leave the spot he had not touched his food or water We left his food bowl next to him. In the morning when we woke up, he was still in the same spot we also put his bed next to the table but he had not left the spot and he had not touched the food. What can I do? What to do for him to eat something ( I cannot just leave him alone all day and see if he will eat his food the next morning again its like I open his trauma and I feel so bad but I cant go back in time (I dont want to drag him out because Im afraid he will be more aggressive) its like he completely changed and he started biting when my dad or family reach out to him and take him out of the table but I think after 12 PM if he still doesnt come out we have to use force and take him out to eat something. What can I do in this situation yesterday I was loud with my dad when watching the TV I think this and after accidentally kicking him frightened him even more what can I do? Please help! thank you

Update to everyone thank you so much! He came out this morning when I called out his name softly. I lay on the ground apologizing yesterday night at a distance and today he still looks scared but came out and let me pet him. I apologized to him over and over again thank you so much for all the advice really It really helped me so much I was freaking out and felt so bad and didnt know what to do its like my brain stop moving (It is 100 percent my fault for getting excited at the moment and hitting my dog in the leg as a result. I need to be more careful of my surroundings since the day I had the pleasure of adopting this lovely dog, I am responsible for his wellbeing and I ruined it. To be honest, I did watch television out loud occasionally in special events before it was never too loud and my dog had no problem with it, he did not show any difference when watching television and would sometimes sleep next to the TV or laptop when I watch movies out loud but after reading some comments, maybe I need to be more mindful and not to make any loud noises around my dog (I feel so stupid saying this but ever since we gained his trust, he never had any trauma responses so we were totally not prepared for when this happens (Of course 3 years ago I researched alot on what to do and in each situations but this time its like I forgot everything and was panicking and this time I caused it) because of this situation, I found out there is a lot I do not know and how to prepare for situations like this again and to calm down whenever this happens (not that I will let this happen ever again (as in me causing the same situation and Im sure maybe in the future something like this might happen again, I would know what to do I will be more better prepared) again thank you so much everyone I really wouldnt know what to do in the situation without it because I was not thinking/ calm I just keep thinking over and over again I messed up but there is no point doing that and I am just making the situation worse but now I know I should immediately drop to the floor and apologize slowly glance at him and glance away at a distance there is still much to learn for me but I will try to be a better owner thank you everyone",dogs,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qmqrs/please_help_i_accidentally_kicked_my_former/
2023-11-08,1699453058,Dog Jumping at Dog Park,"Hello. So we have 3.5 years old Boston Terrier mix (3/4 BT, 1/4 beagle). Hes recently picked up a bad habit at the dog park, which involves jumping up on people. He didnt used to do this, but now jumps up on some people. Its not all the time, but usually more so to people he can smell treats on. He doesnt do this to my partner or I when there.  Most people are understanding and turn away from him when he does this, which my dog will then respond to by going into a sit. Some people are not super impressed with this behavior, and they have every right to be annoyed/upset with my dog. How have people dealt with a jumpy dog at a dog park? Remove them from the park when they jump? Stop going all go together?

2023-11-08,1699452337,Is dog toy stuffing safe for dogs?,"My dog would chew up any stuffed toy and remove and chew the stuffing. We keep stitching them back and he would again open the stitches and start removing the stuffing. 

Is that stuffing harmful for dogs? For now we are keeping his stuffed toys away from him but he loves them. So far the longest lasting ones we got were from IKEA! Those from pet shops are done for within an hour of his getting hold of them. 

Any ideas on other toys which are plush but without stuffing and yet soft and thick? I am in south-east Asia so do not have luxury of checking US or European stores unless they deliver here (delivery may be more expensive than the toy anyway)!",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qmczt/is_dog_toy_stuffing_safe_for_dogs/

Some say raw could have significant food safety concerns  in part considering the gut of a domesticated dog is quite different from that of its canine ancestors.

2023-11-08,1699415479,Want to bring my corgi on a flight,"Hi! I was curious if anyone had experience working with an airline to allow their dog to travel with them? I have a 22 lb male neutered corgi who I want to fly with from SF to Cleveland. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of what I'm seeing says he either has to fit under the seat or travel in cargo hold. I'm absolutely not letting him fly in the cargo hold. 

I've seen people successfully bring their non-service animal medium/large dogs onto flights. I considered purchasing an extra seat but it sounds like they still would require him to go under the seat? 

Does anyone have any experience or tips to help get my pup to be able to fly with me? I'm fine with keeping him in the carrier but he's not going to fit comfortably under the seat. 

Thanks so much!!!!!",dogs,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qd5sk/want_to_bring_my_corgi_on_a_flight/
2023-11-08,1699415756,[Discussion] [Behavior] How to get dogs to like nails being done?,"Any tips for getting a dog to like nails done? I have a 7 month old Aussie that I got about a month ago. 

He was fine with his nails being done when I got him. But then I accidentally quicked him a few times. Then we slowly worked back and he was OK. But now he just keeps pulling his paws away and sitting down and just trying to get out of it, I'm just worried he's going to end up like the other dogs and that I will never never be able to touch his feet. I don't wanna mess him up like I messed up the other dogs. I want him to love having his nails done, but I don't know how to do that. I always have my mom treating him well I do his nails, but apparently it's not working. 

Im having a hard time because I have to take a lot of breaks because Im very impatient and just want to get it done, but I want him to like it. 

I see videos of people with their dogs just perfectly loving their nails being done. 

I know people are just going to say touch his paws and reward! But Ive been doing that, and no difference. 

His nails arent long! Ive been using the dremel because there isnt a whole lot to clip, but you can still feel his nails and they still feel long when he jumps up or even just feeling his paws. 

My other dogs hate having their nails touched so I just gave up, which I always feel guilty  for. My senior gets hers trimmed at the vet, and my others just scratch their paws at sandpaper on a board (which kinda work, but doesnt get them super short and can make some sharp points). 

I just want him to like it. I dont want to mess him up.",dogs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qd8ny/discussion_behavior_how_to_get_dogs_to_like_nails/
