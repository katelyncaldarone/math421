2023-10-12,1697134374,Having to give our rescue back,"My girlfriend and I recently got a dog about three weeks ago we named in Raphael(3) raffy for short. He is Jack Russell, and Chihuahua we suspect. he is perfect in almost every way imaginable he is potty trained doesnt bark which is good since we live in an apartment is good with other dogs. And hes genuinely so so sweet and really loves us, as do we. But he is over protective to a point where it is concerning if hes laying next to me and my girlfriend tries to touch him or me he gets upset upset and growls, vice versa or with any person he seems to be sitting with at a particular time. Which is something Ive been able to somewhat diffuse, but everything changed this Sunday. He was sitting on the floor between my girlfriend, and my nephew(9). We were playing and Raff was kssng everybody and everything was great. I step out of the room for a minute and he bit my nephew on the neck. Thankfully, my sister is cool about it. It barely left a mark, but it was an aggressive type of lunge. And over the last few nights when I come home from work, my girlfriend is already in bed with him and he growls and has nipped at me a few times before even trying to touch my girlfriend or get in my own bed. I just dont think this is anything that we could really fix right now. Trust me I love this dog to death and if there was anything I could do to help him I would do it but my girlfriend is hysterical about it and we came to the conclusion last night that he was probably better off just going back to the foster( I still took a lot of convincing). We cant be scared to live in our own house. It breaks my heart and I still really dont want to give him back but I dont see a way forward. I wanted to ask you guys to better judge if its something we could actually fix or am I actually making the best decision for my girlfriend and I and the dog. 

Sorry for the long post

2023-10-12,1697119975,People insisting my dog not being the breed he is.,"My family got a puppy at 8 weeks, as being cockapoo. There is nothing about it to suggest ii is. It looks like a cocker spaniel , although it was quite wavy when it got her , but has since the hair has become straighter. We take him out all the time to parks, dog parks etc. When people ask me what breed he is, I always responded cockapoo. There would be people who would express that he is nothing like a cockapoo, and I would agree and we move on. But two days ago, when I responded oh he is a cockapoo but looks more spaniel , the women started being snarky/mean and told me how he definitely is not a cockapoo and I probably was not as knowledge about the breed than she is. And lectured me about ethnical breeding... She was also a doddle/cocker owner.  


I don't know if next time people ask what breed he is, should I just reply as cocker spaniel? I don't know what to do in this situation. I also don't mind if he really is a cocker spaniel but I feel like this would not be possible because the place currently breeds cockapoos still.",dogs,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1767y83/people_insisting_my_dog_not_being_the_breed_he_is/

2023-10-11,1697062649,Can my 2 cats and new dog co-exist?,"Hey all, I just got a female lab mix that is 1 year old about a month ago, and currently have 2 male cats that are 3 years old, and Im curious if you think they can both co-exist. Really I just want to make sure that she wont kill them. As long as I know its possible, based on the context Ill provide below, then Ill feel much better

At the moment the dog is on the leash at all times in the house. 



Just to give context on their current POSITIVE interactions:

For that first week she was pretty fixated on them, which I read is normal. shes definitely lost some interest in them as time has gone on. They can walk around the house with her on the couch and shell for the most part ignore them

While shes leashed in the house,  well walk past the cats in hallways and staircases and she ignores them

Even At night time we all hang out on the bed and watch tv together with the cats coming and going as well and she does good. She lets them sniff her and theyve even all went to sleep near each other while on the bed with us before we put her in the crate for bedtime.

There noses have touched on 1 or 2 occasions, so the cats let her get in their face 

Like the dog will sit completely down in front of the cats and look very gentle. Weve even seen her play with other small dogs and she does really well


The problem is, our cats are so damn nosey and in the way! Like they are not afraid of her at all and are always right there watching. 

They also get occasional zoomies and those quick movements catch her attention and trigger her 



For context on the NEGATIVE interactions:

There have been maybe 5-7 negative interactions, with maybe 5 of those involving food/treats. So I totally understand that could be the lone variable, and we have taken steps to reduce food type situations happening, such as feeding her in a crate. 

In regards to food, she mostly will come across aggressive towards the cats if my wife is preparing the food in the kitchen, and cats come in the room to watch. Or if were giving her a treat and the cats get too close

But with her aggression in those moments I cant tell if its just standard food aggression or if she is taking it too far. 

Outside of food, one of the negative interactions happened in a room where my 1 cat and the dog were looking at each for about 5 seconds about 2 feet apart while on a leash, and the dog did a play bow, Then began barking. 

my wife is a groomer at a  doggy day care and the dog goes there with her, so she took it as normal and the dog wanting to play, but to me it just looked aggressive. She thinks the barking was just from the dog being upset the cat wasnt playing, as she sees this at her job

Idk if because my wife works at a doggy day care that she is seeing things through a different lens.

One time she looked like she went to bite the cats tail, but it was a slow and soft attempt and sort of came across playful, but After seeing that i get pretty cautious when I see the tail go near her

Overall, there have been tons of positive interactions and signs that this is possible, its just the small amount of negative interactions that make me question does she has a prey drive? Does she have it in her to snap and kill them?

At some point, do the cats and dog understand each others movements and get to a point where we can trust the dog not on a leash in the house?

Its okay if it takes time, I just need to know based on my situation that its possible. Last thing I want is this going on for 6+ months of trying to integrate them, and the dog takes it too far and injures the cats and we have to give her up

2023-10-12,1697083329,Puppy is a nightmare to crate train,"For background, Ive been working in animal rescue for over a year, fostering for 2.5 years, and have had my own behaviorally challenged dog for nearly four years. Im fairly experienced with training and have crate trained every dog who has lived with me. I am familiar with transition periods and the 3-3-3 rule. I make sure she gets positive things in the crate, like her meals and high value enrichment and toys. I have never had a dog who was so difficult to crate and house train and after a week of barely sleeping Im starting to reach the end of my rope. 

I adopted an eight-month-old puppy last week. Shes very bright, food-motivated, walks well on a leash and has learned basic commands very quickly. Whenever I leave her alone she barks nonstop for at least 30 minutes, claws at the bars of her crate, and will not settle down. Often times she will pee and poop in the crate and bury it under whatever bedding she has. I tried taking away the bedding to see if it would discourage her from pooping and burying it, but she just shoved it between the bars through the crate divider and smeared it everywhere. I tried leaving her in a room to see if she felt better, but she just began screaming/barking and clawing at the door and walks, so I cant let her free roam. I never punish her for pottying in the crate or for barking. I usually take her out for a quick potty break when shes whining or barking, but she wont potty- she just sits there and stares at me because she wants attention. As soon as the potty break ends and she goes back in the crate, she starts freaking out again. 

Folks who have had dogs who hated the crate, what did you do? Is this normal puppy behavior, and Ive just gotten lucky with my foster dogs?",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/175xszl/puppy_is_a_nightmare_to_crate_train/

2023-10-12,1697084049,Dog wants to sleep outside at night in the cold and rain,"I'm currently writing this at midnight as she lays out in the (fenced-in) yard in 50 degree weather with rain coming down, after she barked for me to let her out yet again. If I don't let her out she'll bark every few minutes all night long (I've tried that before). She won't come inside unless I go out and pick her up, or if I offer her a treat (which she tries to take outside unless I quickly close the door).

She's a seven year old golden retriever. I got her from a rescue about a year and a half ago. She started wanting to sleep outside a few months ago, and during the warmer summer months I wasn't too worried. Now that it's getting colder I'm getting more worried about leaving her out overnight, especially when raining.

She has multiple beds inside in addition to a crate with another bed, and it's cool, dark, and quiet at night. She doesn't need to use the bathroom; she just wants to lay down and sleep on the grass. It doesn't matter if she's in the crate or not; she'll bark to go out either way. Sometimes she'll want to go out (and stay out) as early as 10 PM, other times she'll sleep inside until 3 in the morning before starting to bark. She usually wants to come back in around 6-7 because that's when she gets breakfast, and she'll come to the door and bark if I'm not letting her in ""on time.""

Her vet says that there's nothing medically wrong with her, and she might just be getting cantankerous because of her age. They did share my concern about respiratory illness and wet fur/skin though.

2023-10-12,1697085861,I Broke My Ankle and Looking for Alternatives to Walking My Dog,"Three years ago my wife left, leaving me with our daughter and dog. Eventually we worked out custody and she has my daughter three days a week, and though it was my wifes dog, and she was supposed to take the dog those days as well, ultimately I was left with him, religiously walking him 3 times a day, 7 days a week - not just for exercise but to go to the bathroom - and what I always feared has recently happened: I injured myself, seriously breaking my ankle, needing surgery, and I cant walk him.

Hes a large English Lab, and a bit willful, but very loving, but he can he hard for some people to walk. Also, Im unable to have a fence in my yard due to an easement by the township, so walking him has been my way to let him go to the bathroom and get exercise - though it can be demanding: no matter the weather, no matter my health, I never miss a walk.

Now that Im injured, my ex finally agreed to take him the three days she has my daughter - but I need to find a solution for the other 12 walks per week. My daughter is limited in times she can walk him due to school and extracurricular activities, my mom is too old to be able walk such a large dog, and my girlfriend is flaking out, vacillating between saying shell walk him but then telling me all the reasons shes too busy to. Ive tried to find dog walkers on Rover but they all have spotty availability, and trying to stitch together a schedule is becoming quite difficult - not to mention it would cost $300/week (12 x $25).

So Im looking for ideas on what to do at the times I cant find someone to walk him. For example, should I tether him in the backyard for a half hour at the times he normally walks, so he can pee &amp; poop? I know that sounds like a stupid question be hes so used to only peeing &amp; pooping while on a walk that he only does a quick pee and never poops when Id try taking him in the yard in the past.

Please, Im open to any ideas.

What can I do to keep it happy, healthy and occupied?","Volunteered at a shelter in my country and decided to foster a puppy. He's not exactly a puppy, more of a teenage dog at this point. He was a street dog before they brought him in, so he's a mutt and I don't know the breed at all.

Although I'm a cat person, I have had [family] dogs before and still have them back at my parents' place. But those dogs grew up in a more countryside setting where they could play outside in the grass, shrubs and are allowed to run around all day inside a gated compound + getting to go on hikes up in the mountains. So they were more low maintenance in that aspect.

The problem is, I live in the city at the moment in a one bedroom apartment. It's not the same kind of enrichment the dogs I have back home had, so I didn't need to keep them occupied as much.

I can maybe walk it around the subdivision/buildings I'm at but not sure if that would be enough. I don't want him to be bored and end up destroying stuff in the apartment either.

I'm also aware it takes longer for dogs from shelters to warm up to you or trust you. They might be a bit harder to train too.

2023-10-12,1697115768,Rescue won't take back feral foster dog.,"Update Oct 13: After reading how unusual it was to get that response from the rescue; I got in contact with the owner herself to ask if this was her policy or just the person's, tasked with helping me, way of guilt tripping me into keeping the dog. She said this was not what was expected of me and that they will try to find placement for him within the next week. I'm still unsure about that. I checked petfinder yesterday. He was supposed to be put on there in like July. He was not. Also no mention of him on their fb page. 

To answer some questions though:

1. I did not sign a contract for this specific dog. I did fill out a general foster application. 

2. The dog is not microchipped. 

3. I have come to find out that this particular rescue has been banned from local facebook groups due to her dumping dogs onto unsuspecting fosters, not getting proper paperwork to send dogs across state lines, taking donations without taking the dogs, and causing unnecessary drama in the rescue community. This is all fairly recent. As in within the time I have been fostering for them.

-
Original:

In February 2023 I offered to be a temp foster for 1 of 4 feral dogs that needed rescue or would be euthenized the next day. This would be my first and only time fostering.

Since I was only 1 of 2 fosters at the time I specifically asked for it to be one of the further along better behaved/more receptive to help dogs. (1, 3yo dad, 3 of his 1yo sons. Shelter had them a year and had been working with them.)

I got the dad with the most baggage. Spoke w/ other fosters and their pups warmed up pretty quickly. He's actually very sweet now but doesn't like pets. In the 7 mo he's been with us he has warmed up. He doesn't growl or bark at us anymore. Follows us around and gives kisses. 

My 1yo son has started walking and loves our 3 dogs and also wants to love on Papa. Since he isn't comfortable with pets I have been leaving him in our fenced yard while my son is awake and letting him in while he's napping/sleeping. 

He's been digging holes in our yard, getting through bricks, and escaping under the fence. If I were to leave him inside he chews everything but his toys. 

All this time the rescue refused to help with any costs like food, tick/flea prevention, etc. I went into fostering believing the ""fostering is free"" I've heard so many times. I really should've asked up front. That's my fault. 

Anyways.. I contacted the rescue that tagged these dogs about needing to find him another foster within a couple weeks, 2 weeks ago now. 

Yesterday I get a call saying that if I don't personally find him a home to stay in that it would then be my responsibility to put him down because there are no fosters for feral dogs.

So now I'm wondering if this is a scare tactic to get me to keep him? Or am I really responsible for this / is this a thing fosters have to do sometimes? I wouldn't put him down but am wondering what are my actual options here.",dogs,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1766h5a/rescue_wont_take_back_feral_foster_dog/
2023-10-12,1697084993,[Breeds] recs please!,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* NO. My husband and I have been raised with dogs in the home our entire lives. I'm a certified groomer. We currently have a rough collie and a weim but have experience with a variety of breeds.  
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* Preferably a breeder   
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* Our son (6) has been asking for a small dog of his own. Since we have two 40+lbs dogs that are still young and can play rough, it would ideally need to be a bit sturdy (avoiding italian greyhound style thin legs and such for example). We also do not have the tolerance for a yappy small dog as our home is loud enough.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I've been leaning towards the terriers but I know they can be on the independent side so open to suggestions!!  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Must have good tolerance for kids (under supervision of course) and would like to train to be off lead around our farm.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* Not directly, but we do have a horse farm and take our dogs with us to the barn, on trail rides, and to horse shows.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* Potty training and initial manners training asside, 30 minutes to an hour would be ideal.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* Plenty of exercise to be had playing with dog sisters and cousins. We would not use a dog park, but family members bring their dogs to the barn as well.   
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* Grooming requirements are not an issue since I am a professional groomer.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* The smaller the better while still being able to keep up with the bigger dogs. I know my son will want to carry/cuddle the new one.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Shedding is not an issue. Barking to alert us to something being off (strangers for example) is fine, but ideally won't bark at the leaves moving on trees outside or just to hear themselves bark. The less slobber the better.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* Very important being on a farm.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Snuggly cuddle bug!!  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* More on the eager-to-please side. I would like to include my son in the training process.  
  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* A bark or two is okay just to get our attention. Gretting visitors happily/calmly would be nice as we have friends over a lot.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* No, that's not something we could handle at this time.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* I want to avoid resource guarding and nipping as much as possible.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* Not very often. Maybe the occassional 8ish hour day. We both work from home so there is usually someone here with the dogs.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* Our son wants a small dog of his own so a loyal little dog that just wants to be with him would fit the bill. Our collie gravitates more towards me and our weim gravitates more towards my husband. Us adults don't like the yappy little dogs so hoping to avoid ""little dog syndrome"" as I call it. I don't like the typical brachi breeds, I feel like they are always struggling to breathe with their poor smooshed noses.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* Previously mentioned, we have a 1yr rough collie and a 2yr weimaraner. We also own horses.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* YES, both living in the home and as visitors.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* No, we built and own our forever home.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Kentucky. I am not aware of any breed restrictions in my area.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* The average high in the summer is 90\* F and the average low in the winter is 25\* F.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
\* Trying to avoid the typical froo-froo purse dogs since my son will grow up through his teen years with the dog (accidents and illnesses aside) but I'm also open to them if they can be groomed to appear more on the masculine side (like poodles). Thank you all in advance for suggestions!

2023-10-12,1697111717,Fellow spare humans - does the dog refuse to go on walks with you too?,"My partner and I have been together for a year, do not live together but see each other frequently. She's had her 4 year old dog for about 2.5 years (rescue). She's an incredibly sweet dog and seems to genuinely like me and I consider her my step dog if that makes sense haha. However whenever I dogsit her, making her go outside is a real ordeal. It doesn't help that she is quite lazy so the only time she goes at all is if she really has to go potty (even that takes convincing) and then right back. I have my tricks for those situations but taking proper walks or taking her from A to B is impossible which is inconvenient sometimes (and a bit sad for me since I would love going on walks just the two of us).

I think I am asking less for advice but more if other people face the same and if there is a chance this will improve once we live together. The dog can easily be left alone for a couple of hours so she doesn't have typical abandonment anxiety she just seems to be very dedicated on waiting for my partner right where she left her (other people have this issue too).",dogs,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/176566r/fellow_spare_humans_does_the_dog_refuse_to_go_on/
2023-10-12,1697112816,My dog is scared of all Humans,"Hi All.

I adopted a rescue dog this week and due to zero socialisation as a puppy she is scared of all humans. 

The whole time she's inside she hides under an old cocktail table I have. She'll mostly take food and treats off me (ham being her favourite), but if she sees me she starts shaking and backing up.

She's not all aggressive, I had to pick her up a few times to get her to my house, and back inside after she went out one time, she hasn't gone out since, even though her hiding spot is right by the door and I keep it open for her all the time. She's also not bothered by my cats, and even followed them around for a bit when she did go out. There's no other animals or humans that live here.

I've tried leaving her to her hiding spot, she'll only come out at night when I'm in bed, and this is when she'll go to the toilet (in the house).

I've been approaching her with treats and a soothing voice, and trying to sit with her to help desensitize and get used to my smell, but I feel like she's retreating more and more under the cocktail unit.

If anyone has any advice and activities I could do with her, help ease her anxieties and reassure her that'd be greatly appreciated, I'm really willing to work with her and let her know she's in her forever home. Also, is it worth me taking her out of her hiding spot and picking her up to take her outside and bringing her back in again? I'm worried this would make her more scared but it could also be a way of desensitizing her to me.

Background about me: I've grown up with and always had dogs, mainly border collies, most of which were rescues with various backgrounds, but this is the first dog I've dealt with that had such as strong fear specific to humans.",dogs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1765im7/my_dog_is_scared_of_all_humans/
2023-10-12,1697106764,Help- Ideas for mental stimulation,"Hi, I have a 7 month old Kelpie pup. If you know Kelpies, youll know they need A LOT of mental stimulation and entertainment as well as so so much attention&

My issue is, some days, or for a large chunk of a day, he can be particularly crazy. I really mean crazy. He will not settle for hours. I am at a loss. Definitely was to be expected as a puppy of course, so it isnt a surprise to us - but these particular times he just goes wild, gets very destructive and whinges like there is no tomorrow for attention. No matter what I do or how much exercise he gets, he just wont settle. (Most days though, he is an easy, happy wee angel). 

He does have a s**t tonne of toys to play with. Benebone and Nylabone chew toys, soft squeaky toys, expensive toys that are supposed to be mentally stimulating. But on these crazy hours he usually gets tired of them or destroys stuff. 

I might add- everyday he gets at least 3 big off-lead runs at a local park or an outdoor field area. As well as 2-3 short walks on-lead around the block. He is definitely not confined inside all day or deprived of exercise! (He also has our backyard to play in too). 
We have also started letting him play around with other dogs at the park if they approach him but he is often a bit too puppy-excited for the other dog. 

SO point is- any suggestions of what I could get him as a new source of entertainment? Something I can make? Should I set up some sort of obstacle course? Is there a calming activity or toy? ANYTHING. Also, know of any squeaky toys that are close to indestructible? He loves squeaky things!

2023-10-12,1697073267,Grown out of playing with other dogs?,"My very high-energy cavoodle used to love playing with other dogs at the dog park, and it was one of few ways to spend enough energy for her. She's just turned 3 and in the past year I noticed that she no longer wants to play with other dogs, preferring to lie down in the grass, even when other dogs want to play with her. She's still happy and sociable, and LOVES humans (always have), but now she doesn't run unless it's to fetch a ball, or we are running together.

Is this a natural thing? Others at the park look unconvinced when I tell them that she has changed. We also moved houses twice, once to a high-density apartment where she had less space in nearby parks, and the other dogs in the area also seemed to not be allowed to run free or even sniff each other by many of the owners (and many dogs were anxious/snappy when you pass them). It wasn't ideal but she wasn't deprived and was never hurt. That was for about 8 months. Now we've moved to a more spacious house with a nearby large park and plenty of playful dogs, but I feel like she either grew out of it, or adapted to not playing and can't adapt back?

She's hyperfocused on the ball if I bring it, which is great fun, but feels like a different thing y'know? Like less open-hearted goofy. I wonder if I've inadvertently made her less social/outgoing with other dogs, and if there's anything I can do (or should do) to encourage it back. I just don't want her to miss out. Or is it a normal thing at the ripe age of 3 lol.

2023-10-12,1697070717,Dog Park Collar Concerns,"
I'm seeking your collective wisdom regarding a recent experience at the dog park with my doodle. 

My 8 month 50 lbs doodle girl was playing with a slightly larger golden retriever, weighing around 65 lbs. I noticed that the golden retriever was persistently biting my dog's collar. Given the size and weight difference between the two dogs, my primary concern is the potential risk of strangulation or injury. I approached the retriever's owner, hoping for some intervention, but his response was rather dismissive. He claimed both dogs were engaged in mutual biting and that it was all in good fun.

Now, I'm no stranger to the concept of playful nipping. Dogs, after all, communicate and play using their mouths. What worried me was the specific focus on the collar.

Safety risk: The collar, when pulled or tugged with force, can create a choking hazard.
Potential for escalation: Even if initially playful, such behavior might escalate to aggression, especially if my dog feels trapped or threatened.

Has anyone else experienced similar behavior at the dog park? How did you handle it?
Do you think my concerns are justified, or am I being overly protective?
Any tips or advice on communicating concerns with other dog owners without coming across as confrontational?

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* Chihuahua because they are independent and can be box trained, but they are a little too small. Basset hound because they are chill and can be alone, but they shed and have health problems. Mini Schnauzer because they are good alone. Dachshund because they are cute and great size, but bark a lot which may not be good for me. Whippet because they check all of the boxes, but are extremely hard to find. Mini Bernedoodle because of the low shedding and size, but may not be good alone.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Potty train, sit, lay down, and recall back to me.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No, don't care.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* Playing inside can be a few hours. Walks I prefer once in the morning and as many times as needed in the evening.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* Short walk in the morning and long walk at night. Not sure if playing inside counts, but I would like to do that. I play golf and hike a few hours every week, so the dog would/could join me for those walking activities.  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* Once a week is fine if I can do it myself. Can clean whatever. If professional is required, I would prefer no more than once every couple of months.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* Small to medium (no more than 60 pounds).  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Minimal barking (but its not like I would get mad if the dog barks), minimal shedding (I have a slight allergy, but I've only experienced that with the very furry double coat dogs ive fostered), don't really care about slobber.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* I live in the city (on a massive park). It would be cool to play fetch off-leash, but not an absolute necessity.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Not sure I care that much. I want a dog that can be snuggled, but it probably won't sleep with me.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* Do its own thing probably.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* I don't have many random visitors, so it doesn't matter much. I live in the city, so the dog cant be aggressive.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* No, I have an amazing park next to my house that has many other dogs in it.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* Potty training is the most essential thing to me. Otherwise, I am not that picky. Like I said, minimal barking is great because I could even bring the dog to the office. I would also prefer if the dog is not prone to ripping apart furniture.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* I am an attorney and work in person at least 4 days a week, but I make my own hours. I am hoping to be able to leave the dog alone during a normal workday (9:30 to 6:30), but I am told that may not be possible. I worked from home when I fostered, so I don't have personal experience with leaving a dog that long. Nonetheless, I can hire a walker a few days a week if necessary.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* My girlfriend lives with me and loves dogs. She will take care of the dog in the mornings, while we take care of the dog together in the evenings.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* Maybe another dog in the future.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* I rent a rowhome, but will buy a rowhome in the same neighborhood next year. Assume no restrictions, but the dog can't be destructive.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Baltimore, MD. I don't want a pitbull (my sister has one, not for me), so there are no restrictions that apply.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* Summer is 83 and winter is in the 40s.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

2023-10-11,1697055636,Husky puppy a bit eager,"Hey guys. I have a beautiful 10 month old female, husky puppy. Shes so sweet and has never shown an ounce of meanness. As a typical of her breed, she loves to run and play, has boundless energy, and is very headstrong. Today I took her to the park where she was playing with a corgi. She loves chasing and wrestling with other dogs. Her and the corgi hit it off immediately, and they were playing really nicely together. They were chasing and wrestling, but it was purely playful but a bit rough. I asked the corgis owner if this type of player was OK. My dog loves to play and sometimes doesnt know when to stop. But Ive never had issues with her being aggressive are hurting another dog. My dog and the corgi played for about 20 minutes with no issues. Suddenly, my dog was on top of the corgi and the corgi yelped and ran to her owner. I apologized and said I would go home with my husky. The owner said please to not worry, that nothing happened. This happened again about five minutes later, this time a louder yelp. The owner again said not to worry and her dog was fine. I decided to take my dog home from that instant. In no moment was she hating her teeth, growling, or acting mean. I think she was just overexcited and due to their size differences she may have scared or almost hurt the other dog. Nevertheless I feel terrible. My baby doesnt have a bad bone in her body but sometimes doesnt know her limits.

2023-10-11,1697057121,Experience Moving with a Dog?,"Hi all! My partner and I recently bought a house and will be moving in end of this month. In March, we adopted a dog (a 1.5 year old blue heeler, actually found her abandoned and injured living in my grandparents barn) and it's been quite a journey. We currently do not live together and basically 'split custody' of our dog like a divorced couple would of their kids (lol). That whole situation wasn't ideal, but we knew it was the best we could do while we were in the process of trying to find a home together (we also could not find our dogs previous owners, did not find anyone who wanted to adopt her and didn't want to bring her to a shelter. I knew I wanted to adopt a dog once we moved so we decided to keep her). I mention all this because at this point, our dog is pretty used to being at different houses and sleeping in different places (she is crate trained, so I mean sleeping in her crate at different places). Both our families also have places up north, so that's given her even more experiences in new environments.  
  
Now that we'll finally be moving, I'd love to hear some tips from people that have moved with their dogs! I'm a little concerned about her regressing on general training or potty training (she's completely potty trained but I wonder about her 'marking her territory' inside at the new house), and in general just adjusting well. My goal is to keep her on a good routine and actively give her treats when she's exploring the house for the first few times, so she has a positive association with it. She also tends to be somewhat reactive to other dogs (pretty typical for her breed). Our yard is fenced in and I'm not sure if the neighbors have dogs, but I do worry about her getting paranoid about neighbor dogs and barking a lot.

2023-10-11,1697056017,Berner vs. lab for potential therapy work.,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*No. My husband grew up with keeshonds and a pug. I grew up with a border collie/aussie mix. When I was 14, we got a GSD/border collie/chow/Rottweiler/other mix (according to 2 DNA tests). I was her main handler right away (walks, puppy classes, training) and when I went to college, I opted to live in a house with roommates rather than live in the dorms so I could keep her with me. She met my husband when she was 5ish years old and lived to be 12.5 years old. We currently have a 1 year old golden retriever! 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would prefer a breeder. We would get on a waitlist and know it would be potentially a year on it. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Good with children, gentle, easy to train, not easily spooked, not fearful of strangers, good with other dogs. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Boxer: Great with kids, silly, intelligent, versatile. I worry they may not have the cool down button for therapy work than the other breeds. They would be my third choice. 

Labrador retriever: We love our golden retriever and theyre super similar to labs, so definitely interested in them. Theyre also more commonly used in therapy work and it would be easy to find a breeder who looks at temperament for this work. 

Bernese mountain dog: similar traits to the other breeds mentioned. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience (some party tricks could be fun). I am a child and family therapist and very interested in animal-assisted therapy with the kids. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

*Probably not. We tried some barn hunt practices with our golden and I got bored. We might pick it up again someday. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Pretty frequently throughout the day. Our current dog is almost always interacting with us, outside of napping. We did 2 group classes with our dog and a few private lessons. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* We walk our golden for about 1.5 miles/day (down from 2-4 miles/day). We dont do dog parks, but golden goes to doggy daycare 1-2 days/week. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We trim nails at home. I brush current dogs teeth at least a few days/week. I dont mind brushing fur daily. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium or large (50-90 pounds). 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* None of these things are deal breakers for us. We have 3 daughters, a golden retriever, and 2 long-haired cats& our vacuum is tired but holding up well. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A mix would be nice! 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking is fine until we say enough. Friendly to strangers and visitors. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*No. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression to anything. High prey-drive. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Practically never. Our dog comes along with us for most errands and to drop kids off/pick them up (working on him being left alone for 30-60 min out of his crate). Husband works 3 12 hour shifts per week and I work remotely and 2 days/week in the office (both days, my husband will be home). 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

*Husband does training sessions and walks if I am unavailable or need a break. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 1 year old golden retriever and 2 cats (who have been raised with dogs. 1 cuddles with him and plays with him, the other secretly likes him). 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

*Yes, 7 year old, 3 year old, and 2 year old. We also have 5 nieces and 1 nephew. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own our house. No HOA. We have a fenced backyard that is medium-sized. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*Oregon, U.S. and not to my knowledge. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* 80-90 in the summer, 30-40 in the winter. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* This is going to sound weird, but I really want to be able to see the whites of my dogs eyes& some dogs have beady eyes and thats not for me.

She refuses to leave her spot on her bed in the corner, and trying to lure her out with toys and treats (even high value ones that she shows a lot of interest in) hasn't worked. We know she is still adjusting to the new environment and is probably going to need a few weeks before she's ready, so we're giving her lots of time and space.

The problem is that she will only go to the bathroom outside on the grass, which means we have to pick her up to get her outside. She doesnt like getting picked up and will shake and try to get away. We know picking her up is not good, but out of concern for her health we've been doing it a few times a day to get her outside. We tried to wait yesterday and see if she would go potty inside, but she still hadn't after 24 hours so we took her out. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to do in this situation? Should we just give her some puppy pads and leave her alone to figure it out? I'm getting concerned that picking her up is really poisoning any trust we build.

FWIW, outside she seems much more comfortable. She's exploring and is willing to interact with us a little. She picked up on the leash and stairs pretty fast as well.

We plan to spend an hour or so playing with her before we get in the car to come home, and hopefully that will help her get over any sickness from the first leg of her trip and give her enough exercise to be able to settle a bit on the ride.

Do you have any suggestions for avoiding car sickness during our trip? I've never traveled with a puppy for this long of a ride, but my adult spaniels usually had car sickness after an hour or so on a trip, so I imagine this will be even more uncomfortable for a tiny puppy.

2023-10-11,1696987345,Alternative to under the bed?,"Our Golden Retriever recently lost weight (thyroid issue, thank God for meds cause shes back to being her goofy, playful, thinner self!), and she likes to show off her weight loss by crawling under our bed EVERY night, like she used to before she became a chunker. She starts falling asleep on the bed, but I swear once she knows were both asleep, she hops off and army crawls under the bed.   
  
This poses a few issues:  

1. She wont crawl out and acts like a helpless princess, so we have to physically lift our very expensive bed/frame to free her. 
 
2. God forbid the bed ever collapsed, shed be crushed (literally). And with the constant lifting of the frame to free her, this is on my mind more and more.  
 
Ive recently started building pillow barriers around the bed, and our girl either moves the pillows or somehow crawls over them to slip under the bed. Not sure why she loves being under there so much, and she only goes under at night, but hoping to figure out an alternative. She never went in her crate when she was a puppy, and she also likes to lay under our reclining foot rests of our couch. 
 
Does anyone have a specific bed that you think shed like? Or any suggestion really. I feel bad trying to keep her out but the thought of the bed falling on her scares me to death.

2023-10-11,1697047482,"Owners who moved their dog to a new climate, how did they handle it?","Hi all!


In July I rescued my dog from Puerto Rico and now he is enjoying life in the Northeast. We are on the coast and New Jersey summers probably weren't too drastic of a change, hot, humid, very typical.


Now that fall is in full swing, I'm wondering if there's any precautions I should take or any behavioral changes to expect? So far he seems to love it, he's been more energetic these last few days as the crisp fall air settled in. Have noticed a reverse sneeze and a few sneezes every now and then, which isn't something he is prone to, but it isn't concerning or abnormal either. But, it got me thinking. I imagine the new climate can affect dogs? He's being exposed to temperatures, air pressures, and all types of allergens he's never been around.


So I ask, those of you who moved your dog - particularly to a cooler climate than they grew up in - did you find your dog had an adaption period during the changing of the seasons? Or reacted to being exposed to any new allergens? I know dogs are very adaptable and the fall, winter and spring won't impact him greatly. I'm just curious if there's anything to expect or prepare for.

Please stop berating my friend, she's just looking for solutions 

Hey fellow pet lovers, my friend needs your help! My friend has a Labernese dog, and the shedding situation has reached critical levels.  Here goes:

She's practically vacuuming twice a day with her trusty Dyson pet vacuum to keep up. Miss a day, and it's a furry apocalypse with tufts of fur all over. To add a twist, there's a curious toddler in the mix who not only crawls around but also puts the hair in their mouth (yikes!).

This morning, she had to vacuum due to an overwhelming amount of fur. Tonight was the designated vacuum and floor-washing night, and she's convinced she had to vacuum twice because whenever the dog strolls by, it's like a fur waterfall, and the cleanup begins again.

Robot vacuums are a no-go due to multiple house levels. The struggle is real! 

Any genius solutions to make daily vacuuming less of a chore? Tonight left her feeling defeated, wondering why she's putting in so much effort only to repeat it all tomorrow.

And before you suggest it, even brushing the pup doesn't seem to stop the shedding. Is there hope, or is her Labernese destined to leave a furry trail everywhere? Share your wisdom, please!",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/175105c/seeking_advice_labernese_dogs_excessive_shedding/

The worst thing is that he also tries to break our meshed fence with his teeth to run away again so we have to keep him on a tight leash, but then his auditory pleads and cries become even louder and I'm surprised that till now none of our neighbours have called the cops on us for disturbing the neighbourhood peace.

Is there any way to possibly train him to eat slower in a regular bowl? He does know ""okay"" and ""stop"". If I say ""stop"" after he takes a bite, he'll chew what's in his mouth for a little bit...then ""okay"" to take another bite, and ""stop"" to chew again. I have no idea if this would work in the long run without having me tell him what to do. If I don't tell him to stop, it's like he forgets to chew.

That keeping them intact will result in an early death and litter galore. I'm now more on the train of keeping dogs intact for their lifetime unless medically necessary at the time or at the minimum of waiting until full maturity is obtained.

He chews blankets when we're cuddling on the sofa, but at those times is easily distracted with chew toys or bones, as long as I'm poking them in his face. He will even eat parts of it if they come off - I have to pick them out of his mouth. He seems to chew for enjoyment rather than trying to eat it as food. He can't have fabric toys as he sometimes eats the fabric or threads, which obviously is not okay for him. He also loves chewing our sleeves and anything else that can be found on people's wrists (watches and bracelets etc).  


However, when he comes to our bed, he will not be likely to accept toys or bones, he chews the bedding. He doesn't seem that interested in eating the bedding, mostly just chewing it until there's lots of holes. I spend a fair bit of time in bed due to health conditions, and he likes to join me. He doesn't sleep in the bed at night as it gets too hot for him.   


Beyond more mental stimulation, is there anything I can do to help him stop chewing the bedding? Vet check recently was fine, though we didn't discuss this issue. Additional exercise has not made any difference so far, and he's not destructive in any other way - he's a really well behaved and calm puppy. No chewing or scratching on other things. He doesn't spend much time alone, and from filming him when he's alone, the behaviour seems mostly the same then. He will chew the bedding if alone in bed, other than that he'll just lie on the floor and wait for us.

Years ago someone ran a red light and struck our vehicle and it put a lot of stress on our family.  She has done some self-harming the last half year.  Of course, we are working with her school and getting her outside care that she needs.  But, because she struggles socially and really needs a friend, getting her a dog seems like good therapy.  We're also trying to motivate her to stay more organized and develop better routines to take care of herself, with a promise to get her a dog in the coming weeks, after she demonstrates she is prepared to take care of it and take care of herself.  She's excited about that and I'm ready to start keeping an eye out for her new companion.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  I had a couple of family dogs growing up which were generally well trained and well behaved.  My wife and I had a border collie that lived until our daughter was 2 years old.  He was super smart and a wonderful dog, but we are looking for a dog that requires less exercise at this time.
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? I'm open to either.
3. Describe your ideal dog. We'd like a small dog that doesn't bark too much, with an easy going temperament, requiring moderate exercise and not too much maintenance.
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Bichon Frise, Boston Terrier, Toy Poodle, French Bulldog - really any smaller dog that barks less than the other small dogs and may be a good companion for our daughter around the house, to take on short walks, and is easy to take with us around town in the car.
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  Basics like sit, stay, walk comfortably on a leash.
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  No
7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? Several hours a day

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  Lower maintenance is preferable, but we're willing to do more grooming if needed.Personal Preferences
10. What size dog are you looking for? 20 lbs or less, even considering toy breeds
11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? We can handle some shedding and slobber but excessive barking is more of an issue.
12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  It would be nice to be able to walk unleashed on some relatively unpopulated nature trails in the area.  But, this is not a deal-breaker.Dog Personality and Behavior
13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? snuggly
14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please? no strong preference
15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? prefer a calmer dog
16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? prefer a dog that gets along with other dogs
17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  We'd prefer a small dog that doesn't bark a whole lot, which I've read, can be uncommon.Lifestyle
18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  I'm retired so the dog will usually have company.
19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  All 3 of us are on board with getting a dog, but the responsibilities would primarily fall on myself and my daughter.
20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  We do have a 18 year old female blue russian indoor cat.  She has some kidney failure but is doing okay.  We had planned on waiting until after she passed away some years from now before getting a dog.  However, after considering the benefits of adding a dog to the family, as a companion for our daughter, we decided the pros outweigh the cons and we'd like to start looking now.  We want to make the transition for her as comfortable for her as possible and she may be needing some extra attention.
21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  Just our 13 year old, not young children.
22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  We own a home with a small backyard, but access to many trails and wooded areas.
23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? We live north of Houston, Texas.
24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? The winters are very mild but the summers are scorchers and can easily hit near 100 degrees for weeks.Additional Information and Questions
25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  Thanks for your time.  Adding a dog to the family is a really big deal under any circumstances and feels especially important to us as we make a decision in the coming weeks.  Any info or suggestions you have to contribute is appreciated.
26. Feel free to ask any questions below.  I'm going to be looking in the east Texas area, for sheltered and rescue dogs, and reputable breeders.

2023-10-11,1697004134,First dog breed help,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
First dog ever (never owned in childhood or adulthood) However I'm planning on volunteering at a local dog shelter to gain some sense of how dogs work.  
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
  
I'd prefer to rescue a dog from a shelter. Mostly because I don't personally like how expensive breeders are/how I'd feel like a pretentious asshole (this is a me thing I'm perfectly fine with others going to reputable breeders it just makes me think I'd look like a rich snob and I'd feel weird about it)  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
Active but not bouncing off the walls every minute they aren't doing something. Fluffy. Must be fluffy I don't care if I have to brush them every day fluff is life. I'd like them to be on the more calm and mellow side of things if possible. Also, have a decent training ability.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
Labrador Retriever (any color not picky about that)

Golden Retriever (again not picky about if it's actually golden)

Pomeranian 

German Shepherd (I live with people who have owned them before and also I'd be willing to research and other stuff about this particular breed as I know they can be hard for first-time owners.)

Any dog mixed with these works as well.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
Sit, Down, Heel, ""Bang"" (you know dramatic pretending to be dead thing, it's just too cute) Leave it, Look at me (To help introduce them to my cats) Come, drop it, wait, quiet, and stay. Basic commands and also some tiny things in there I find cute.   
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
No. I have no experience with any of those things and don't own any farm animals.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
Willing to spend at least an hour a day on training. At most three hours.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
I'm currently doing online school with a very small workload and live with my parents still, so I have plenty of free time to exercise the dog...maybe around 10 hours total a day? I'd like to do training exercises with walks and outside of walks and take the dog to play at a local park in my neighborhood. My neighbors I know also own a young dog of their own so maybe I'll see if they want to join me at the park and let the dogs play a bit.  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
I'm open to brushing however often I need to (daily if needed) but most likely will take the dog to a groomer for ear cleanings.   
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
Medium-Large dog. (Not really big just like 80 pounds maximum I think)  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
Shedding: No preference

Barking: Some barking but would like to be able to work on it through training.

Slobber: Minimal.   
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
I'd be cool but not required to me as I'd be worried about my dog being off-leash even with good recoil.   
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
Mix? If I had to pick one though I'd prefer snuggly.   
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  


I'd prefer an eager-to-please dog as I'm bad with stubbornness (mostly because it would remind me of my younger sibling and me fighting before and I hated it)  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
Maybe an alert bark but able to calm down once they've been reassured it's not a threat. I'd prefer them to be cautious but not aggressive about/be scared.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
As a first-time owner, I doubt I'd be able to read the signs fast enough so I'd prefer a dog that isn't aggressive to other dogs.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
Herding behaviors.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
Hardly ever, someone is always home at the house and I'm only ever gone for about 6 hours maximum on weekends. In this case, more than one person would be at home.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
I'll be caring for the dog, however, the people living with me don't like pit bulls or bully breeds (don't know why but they said absolutely not) The most care they will do is taking the dog on walks/feeding it the few hours I'm away on the weekends.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
I have three resident cats. One is a Siamese (Male: Neutered) Two Tabby cats (One female: Spayed and a Male: Neutered) The oldest is 11 and the youngest is 4.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
No.   
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
I don't rent and don't plan to rent in the next ten years at least.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
I live in the United States in Washington State but not in any city that has breed bans.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
The average high in summer is 77.7F and the low 50F. In winter the average is high if 51F and the low is 32F.

I have a fenced backyard that is about 6-8 feet tall (don't have a measuring while making this post but know it is at least 6 feet tall.)

2023-10-11,1697026567,Adult dog wont potty train,"We rescued a Collie/Shepard mix several months ago. We were told that while he wasnt yet neutered that he was fully potty trained. Later, we found that this just meant that he didnt mess his crate in the week that he was at the rescue. He was estimated to be ~8yrs old.

Since hes been in our home, hes never been able to potty train. First, he marked constantly (which we chalked up to not yet being neutered) so we put him in diapers. After being neutered a few weeks later, we found he was still peeing in the house. Hes now in diapers full-time and pees through them multiple times a day, despite being taken out every 3-4 hours. Its still somewhat of a struggle to get him to pee, though hes always monitored to validate that he actually goes. 

He absolutely refuses to poop in our yard - we have to take him on 1-2 mile walks to be lucky enough to get him to poop. This means at least 5 days a week hes pooping in the house and if theres even a bit of adverse weather, forget it. We can leave the room for what feels like a nanosecond and he will poop. 

I am devastated as Ive grown to really love this dog, but Im not sure what more we can do. Hes a great dog otherwise, but I cannot continue to have him using my house as a toilet. Please help with any guidance or support that you may have.",dogs,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/175clyp/adult_dog_wont_potty_train/
2023-10-11,1696987732,[BREEDS] Finally looking for a dog with new house and new schedule,"My wife and I are finally in a position to get a dog. We had put a hold on it until we were settled and had a stable, consistent schedule. Right now, my wife does not have that but I do. I work 3 days a week and her schedule is all over the place for the next year and a half. We would both love a dog and right now we both understand I will take on the bulk of the responsiblility.   
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
This is not my first dog but this is the first time I am responsibly getting a dog lol. I stupidly got a puppy and raised him for a year while I was in grad school in the midwest. I brought the dog home on the west coast and my parents fell in love with the dog. I decided to end up leaving the dog with my parents because the little guy hated the cold and was miserable in the winter and my parents just had a better schedule. My wife's family had dogs her whole life. I had trained my pup including basic obedience, house manners, potty training, and socialized him. I just did not do a good job on leash training but he is overall well behaved relative to how poorly equipt I was to handle a dog. A testament to dogs honestly. 

We dog sit at times for my wife's families dogs. One is a mutt and one is an akita mix. Lovely pups but the akita mix is leash reactive.   
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
100% a rescue   
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
I would like a dog that is not aggressive with people and other dogs. He doesn't necessarily need to love everyone just not outwardly aggressive toward people. I would like a medium sized dog, preferably 40-90 lbs. I would love a dog that is responsive to handler but is not prone to separation anxiety.   
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
Labrador retriever- the right size I like as well as very responsive to handlers. The breed is energetic which I like but I do worry with my time I may not have enough time to keep a lab entertained. I do like how the breed is relatively easy going with new people, dogs, and situations. 

Golden retriever- same as above. 

German Shepherd- I love how responsive they are to their handlers but this is a long shot. This breed may be a bit ""advanced"" in terms of how sensitive they may be and how much stimulation they need. I do not consider myself an experienced dog owner yet but I would plan on doing obedience classes with the dog and found some positive reinforcement only trainers in my area. 

Beagle- love their temperments. I know this is not a dog that is as responsiive to their owners and can be a bit more independent which I am ok with. I know they aren't off leash dogs which is fine with me as well. They are on the smaller size and I do want them to be a little more engaged but I know each breed is different. 

Rottweilers- Love the breed for the size, loyalty, and general goofiness. My wife fostered a rott for a bit and I like how confident they are. The stubborn streak and size is a bit of concern.   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
General obedience for sure but more than that I have been doing k9 scent work at time with my parents dog when I dog sit and we had a lot of fun. I am interested in this. Not much experience but I have looked into it and have found trainers and classes. 

  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
Obedience and agility is something I think I would be interested in but I have no experience in. There are classes near me I have looked up. I'm not sure if a dog would benefit from scent work AND agility at the same time, I would prioritize scent work since I can probably do that at home and in a class setting easier.   
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
I work 3 days a week but those days i work 10 hours and would be gone 11 hours of the day. My wife has a variable schedule so there are weeks where soemone is home at all times and there are days where the dog will be left alone for up to 3 days a week. We have a reliable dog walker near us that we have hired previously for dogs we dogsit and I am intereste in possibly doggy day care 1 day week at most. 

On days I am off I have plenty of time to interact with the dog. Those are days I am saiving for scent work, possibly agility work, and hikes around my area as well as basic obedience. It's those days I am at work where I can take the dog out in the morning and after I work.   
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
For the days I work I can probably exercise my dog at least 1 hour. I would have 15-20 minute walks in the morning, dog walker can do 20-30 in the afternoon, and my wife and I would do 20-30 at night. Days I am off I can plan on 2+ hours with the dog. My wife's schedule is variable but she can help out sometimes during the weekdays and on other weeks she will be unable to help at all. It will be mostly me for the next yer and a half and then she finishes her heavier work load and can take on more dog duties.   
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
I am not against brushing a dog but my previous dog did not need it. I can do weekly brushing and pay for a professional preferably.   
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
Medium to large, probably 40+ lb  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
I do not mind any of it. Prefer less barking but it is not a deal breaker.   
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
Not as important to me.   
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
I love a snuggly dog. My wife likes a dog that has some independence but can be snuggly as well. I think having a dog that can be good with kids is important since we have friends who come with their kids and family and we would like a family in the future.   
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
Prefer eager to please. I love a dog that is responsive to training and the handler.   
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
I would prefer a dog that is overall friendly. I do not mind barking a few times but I would hope the dog would settle quickly. He/she does not need to be the worl'ds friendliest dog, but a dog who is not enraged at strangers or visitors and can settle and assess quickly.   
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
this is one thing I do not have a lot of experience in. My wife's family has an akita mix that is a bit dog reactive. I can manage by being able to walk . the dog when we dog sit in times where there are less people. I would be wiliing and I have looked up ways to disengage dogs from triggers with positive reinforcement.   
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
Destructive in the house which can be hard to predict. I think dogs that are nervous around kids or are reactive with other dogs would be not prefered.   
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
For the next year and a half our schedule is somewhat fixed. I am working 3 days a week. My wife works anywhere from 4-6 times a week including night shifts, early shifts, and late shifts. The dog will be at most alone for 3 days a week, up to 11 hours (with a dog walker in the afternoon)   
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
Time wise in the next year and a half my wife can't offer much time but after that she can take on equal ownership. Her preference is a rescue.   
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
No other pets now. We would love to get a second dog in the future.   
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
Not yet but maybe in a few years. Sporadic interaction with friends and families kids.   
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
NO, we own   
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
No law banning breeds   
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
Typical summer can be 90, winter can be low as 50   
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
I understand working 10+ hours would not be ideal for any dog. My plan is having a dog walker come in the middle of the day so the dog will be alone at most 5 hours. I am hoping the dog can learn our routine, and in a year and a half my wife's schedule lightens up and she can take more responsibility was well.

2023-10-11,1696993452,Our dog is making me anxious with his anxious behaviors,"Boyfriend and I moved in together this summer with his 8 year old male English shepherd. He always has a tendency to be a bit anxious and pant more than most other dogs Ive been around, but when we moved.. oh man. He panted and paced and licked himself aggressively for days and days on end until one day he hurt his leg and was so improved. After a few pretty good weeks and minimal anxious behaviors, hes back to the panting and such. I cant even cuddle with my boyfriend if hes around bc he comes up and pants in our faces. Its literally driving me insane and I feel jittery so often bc of his energy. The dog is also extremely attached to my boyfriend and wont let him leave a room alone without following panting, and we literally have to take him to his moms an hour away in order to leave the house without the dog, bc he cant be alone. (Boyfriend tried that at his old place, dog tore up every door, door frame, and ripped some blinds in half. So needless to say we cant take that chance in a rental). He wasnt socialized and lived on a farm his whole life until this summer, so my family and either of our friends cant come over bc its just such a thing. The dog loves the outdoors but wont go outside without my boyfriend walking/sitting with him. He goes to the park every day and gets lots of attention and toys and such. Were at a loss.. we thought after several months he would be adjusted and doing well but instead Im typing this at 11pm as he sits in the corner and licks himself/pants in a cycle.

2023-10-11,1696988370,Lately my dog has been overly obsessed with me,"I (27F) have a wonderful 7 year old female chocolate lab. I got her when she was 6 weeks old (I was 20 and stupid, I know). If its relevant she is also completely blind due to glaucoma and has been since she was 4.5. 

Anyways, even though she is my dog, my fiancé has been in her life since she was 3 and were pretty sure she thinks he is HER boyfriend (we dont have the heart to tell her lol) because she is obsessed with him. When hes around she tends to have a preference towards him which is fine- hes great so I get it. I know how much she loves me regardless.

The last week or so has been different. She has been attached to me 24/7, and has been way less attentive to my fiancé. 

Am I freaked out? A bit. Im terrified its cancer or pregnancy. The latter is possibly possible but itd be too early to know. Tbh both disease and pregnancy are terrifying possibilities for me right now, so what Im looking for is others thoughts on the matter.

2023-10-15,1697331704,doing a couch-to-5k with 1 yr old golden,"Hi all,

I have a pretty active 1 yr-old male golden, who I exercise really well 2x a day for 40 min to an hour.  Exercise usually consists of some really good fetch &amp; a short walk, or a longer walk &amp; a shorter game of fetch.  We're also working on training more intensively!

The deal is, I want to get more in shape, so I'm wondering if I could involve him in a couch-to-5k program?  I know there's a lot of emphasis on waiting until their growth plates are totally formed, but would such light running harm him? (if you aren't familiar, it's like 1 min running, 1 min walking, 10x, &amp; building up slowly from there) I'm thinking we'll mostly be doing it on a dirt/gravel trail 3x per week.  A brick path is also an option in my neighborhood, but I'd be weary of hurting his joints on it.  I'd even be willing to build up slower just to be on the safe side for him, &amp; of course I'll also be training on how to do this without pulling.

What do y'all think?  Is this still too vigorous exercise-wise for his age?  ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1783u72/doing_a_couchto5k_with_1_yr_old_golden/

never fights with other dogs, never bit a human except when someone in the family tried to pet him while he was sleeping

I'm looking at 3 potential solutions

1. Neutering
2. Muzzle
3. Dental Disarming (essentially filing down teeth so he won't puncture)


Will any of these help? are there any alternate methods,

2023-10-14,1697319983,"Found a young, scared, skinny good boy& what now?","Hey yall! I found a dog today. Super skinny, looks like he hasnt had a proper meal in a long time, seems to be about a year old. When I saw him he was scared and walking in the middle of the busy street. Has a collar but no tags so I took him to a local vet to check for a chip but no dice.. I put him in the back yard and gave him food, water, and some shade to rest. 

Hes a total sweet heart. Looks like a Staffordshire and is pretty skiddish of men until he warms up to you. 

I have an older pyrador currently that I share with ex wife (dog goes with kids) and am keeping them as separated as I can but they played for 20 min or so under supervision and were very friendly with each other and seemed to be getting along. 

I dont know what the next thing to do for the immediate term as well as for longer term. I can take care of him but Id like to think of myself as the last option. Any suggestions are welcome, especially for the immediate next few days&.

****update****

Took him to the vet for a check up. They said he's likely a dump off dog since there's no listing of him anywhere in the area and he's so skinny, he hasn't had a good meal in forever. Also bc the breed, it's not uncommon unfortunately.

Medically poor boy is in rough shape.. they found that he's got hookworms and heartworms. Since I have another dog (who thankfully is at ex's house this week) they suggested to treat the hookworms. That'll be fun to clean up this evening... The heartworms are another story.

We'll need to fatten him up to be able to take the treatment and not die and even then that's a wing and a prayer.

We have some tough decisions to make here, what's not hard is sending him to a shelter only to be put down in a day or so. We're not going to do that. He's been nothing but good, obedient, and his whole demeanor has changed since coming home with me 48 hours ago. Poor thing just needs someone to love him.

**** Update ****
Sweet boy may have just found his home! Right now hes with my girlfriends friend on a trial run for the weekend. Shes aware of his condition and were going to ask around to local shelters and rescue groups for options/support with his vet bills! Thank you all for the encouraging words, it means a lot.

2023-10-14,1697324421,Frat House Dog,"Frat House Dog

Almost 2 weeks ago, 2 older pitbull/lab mixes were tied up to dog park fence and abandoned at a student living apartment complex dog park. One of my fraternity brothers who lives at the complex noticed them tied up for over a day and took them in. After calling many rescues and making multiple social media posts, no one would take the dogs. Finally, someone was willing to take one of the dogs. I do not agree with separating the sisters, but this was not my decision.

So earlier in the week, the fraternity brother who was keeping the dog was going home for the weekend and had no one to watch her. He also has a dog of his own and did not want too keep her permanently. He brought the dog to the fraternity house for us that live there to watch her. The original plan was to find her a home and keep her for the time being. However, like before, no rescue or anyone is willing to take on the dog. She truly is the sweetest, well-mannered, trained dog. We have been spoiling her rotten, taking her on multiple walks a day, and giving her the love and attention she deserves. Originally, I was extremely against bringing a dog into the fraternity house, but along with all the other brothers, I have fallen in love with her. I feared irresponsible pet ownership, but that has been far from the case. She is very easygoing and loves being around people. Music and loud noise dont phase her at all. She stays in the backyard off-leash and is super calm. 

The only issue is she has significant separation anxiety. She cries &amp; cries when left alone. These past couple days, someone is always with her keeping her company. We love having her around for kickback sessions at the fraternity house. However for large parties and formal events at the house, its not right for her to be running around the common areas of the house for her safety. Me and and a new member (who grew up fostering dogs) have been trying to be her primary caregivers. We want to provide her a sense of normalcy and routine from us two. The other night we had a good amount of people over and it was getting late. We agreed it was time to put her up for the night.  We were able to get her in her crate (which we keep in the new members room with her food and where she sleeps at night). She whined and barked when we shut the bedroom door to go back downstairs. Finally, she calmed down when we left the bedroom door opened with her in the crate where she could hear music and people downstairs.  We have been giving her anxiety treats which I think has helped her greatly with this transition period. 

We want to give her plenty of attention and spend lots of time with her, but its not feasible for someone to be with her 24/7. She still is struggling greatly which separation anxiety and I understand it will take time to get her accustomed. We are still deciding if we want keep her permanently at the fraternity house. We want the best for the dog and want to make it work for her at the fraternity house if that could be the case. I also want to add that are fraternity house is a large clean house.

2023-10-13,1697236859,[BREEDS] Breed Recommendations for First-Time Owner,"**Introduction**

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First time as an adult. I grew up with dogs and helped look after them and train them, but never on my own and never as the primary trainer/carer.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder. The health-testing gives me peace of mind, and I like knowing the dog's full history and lineage so I can get an idea of what to expect. I'm not *against* adopting, but most of the dogs for adoption in my area are dog-reactive, people-reactive, or a mix of both.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

* A laid-back dog that goes with the flow, and can have its exercise needs met in 2hrs or less. I'd love a dog that would curl up next to me for a quiet evening, but would also be fine with going off to do its own thing if I'm busy or out of the house. I do need a dog that's good with other dogs, cats, people, and children. It doesn't necessarily have to be the friendliest dog ever -- it just can't be aggressive. Training-wise I'd definitely like a dog that's easier to train, but I can deal with a stubborn one. Just so long as there's something I can do to motivate the dog, whether that's treats or affection or toys.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Rottweilers - My favourite breed, but I know they're generally a bad idea for first-time owners. I love their appearance (I'm a sucker for big, muscular dogs with fat heads) and their overall disposition.
* Beagles - I adore everything about these little guys (baying included, I think it's pretty funny), but I need a dog that can be trusted off-leash, and beagles unfortunately don't fit that bill.
* Bull Terriers - Love the appearance and goofy behaviour, but I'm pretty sure they're way too high energy for me. I've also heard they can be very stubborn and a pain to train. I also have cats, which does not mesh well with their super high prey drive.
* Labrador Retriever - I've got a big soft spot for labs. They're just so dang cute and sweet, though I wish they'd shed a little less. My main concern is their extremely high energy -- I've never met a lab that stopped acting like a puppy. They've made every other breed I've encountered look like a total couch potato, and I'm worried I wouldn't be able to keep up.
* Corgis - I don't know as much about this breed, but they're stinking cute. I do know that they're herding dogs though, which I'm a little wary of -- I know herders are pretty high-energy and generally require a lot of physical and mental stimulation to keep them happy. Anecdotally, the only herding dogs I've encountered are high-strung, anxious wrecks -- I don't know if that's just the individual dogs, or if it's a herding dog thing.
* Great Danes - I love a good gentle giant type dog, and these guys fit that pretty perfectly. Their lifespan is much too short for my liking though -- I don't think I could handle having the dog die so early (I know any dog can die early, but a life expectancy of 6-7 years is way too short).

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* General obedience (sit, stay, lie down, leave it, recall, and whatever else they teach in obedience classes), fun tricks like rollover or play dead, and some agility or tracking if it needs more mental stimulation.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No.

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* At *least* three to four hours for walking, training, and playing. But probably more -- I work from home and am a total homebody, so I'll be able to spend a lot of time with the dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* About 2hrs per day of walking. The dog parks in my area are iffy -- some have garnered a pretty poor reputation, but if I can find a good one that's not overrun by people who don't train their dogs, I'd definitely go at least once a week.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Brushing once or twice a week is fine. I don't mind cleaning ears or bathing the dog. A bit of trimming would be fine, but anything more than that and I'd pay a pro. I definitely prefer low-maintenance, short coats to long ones though.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

* I prefer medium to large sized dogs, but I don't mind little dogs as long as they're sturdy-looking.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Any amount of shedding is fine. I can handle barking, whining, etc. I prefer no slobber but can handle some, as long as it's not a Newfie or a St. Bernard and their torrential downpour of drool.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important. I definitely prefer to keep the dog leashed 99% of the time, but there's an unfenced property that I visit somewhat frequently. It's on an island -- so the dog would have to go for a swim in order to escape -- but I know that's not a deterrent for some dogs (I've seen a few escapees). I definitely can keep the dog leashed until it's trustworthy, but keeping it leashed 100% of the time on that property would be less than ideal, and I'd be concerned about leash aggression with any unleashed dogs.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'd like some snuggles, but not all the time. A nice in-between is preferable, but I can compromise.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Definitely eager-to-please. The easier to train, the better, though I don't mind working with a more stubborn breed so long as they can be motivated by something (food, toys, attention, whatever -- I've had to help train a dog that isn't motivated by anything and I never want to do it again).

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* One or two alert barks is fine, excessive barking is something I'd want to train out of. I'd like to train the dog to also not rush up to the person coming in too. Definitely no jumping on them either.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Not really. As long as I can train a behaviour out (like jumping, destructive chewing of walls/furniture/shoes, pulling on the lead, etc.) I don't mind dealing with it.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not often. I'm a homebody and I work from home. There may be a day or two when I need to go into the office, but I'm almost never there for the full 8hrs. I have no issues with putting the dog in doggy daycare or finding a sitter for those days if I need to.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* N/A, it's just me.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, I have cats.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not generally, but it may need to interact with them a few weeks out of the year (and never without supervision as the kids are all less than 5. They're well-behaved and respectful of dogs, as much as a little kid can be).

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No and none.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Ontario, Canada. Pitbulls and Staffordshire Bull Terriers are banned province-wide, and any dog that bears a resemblance to them can be seized and taken away.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is usually around 25C to 27C, though it's not uncommon for temperatures to get as high as 35C for a few weeks. Winter is usually -10C to -15C, with some really cold days dropping to -20C and beyond.

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I have a small-ish home (\~1000sqft) with a medium-sized yard. I don't think the yard is big enough for a dog that doesn't like walks and gets its exercise solely through playing.
* I don't want a super brachycephalic breed, like pugs, bulldogs, boston terriers, etc. I'd be fine with a mild case that doesn't hamper the dog's ability to breathe (I think bull mastiffs fit that bill, from what I can remember).
* I'm not the biggest fan of super droopy-eyed dogs. I think a lot of them are cute (I mean, how could I not think a basset hound is cute?) but the increased risk of eye issues, especially entropion/ectropion makes me nervous.
* ~~I've heard greyhounds are pretty good dogs, but I'm admittedly vain and not a huge fan of how they look.~~ I'm an idiot and didn't realize that greyhounds and Italian greyhounds are completely different breeds, so I'll be looking into greyhounds now.

2023-10-14,1697302255,How do I train my 11 year old dog to go to the bathroom in a specific spot again,"TW: Some gross talk about poop and butts

My dog has a very rare condition and a unique routine with how he goes to the bathroom so some background first to understand the situation.

A few years ago we found a tumor in my dogs rectum, I dont know the full details but after many surgeries, medication, and diet changes we got it under control. There is a splint in his rectum now which effectively means there is a much smaller hole his stool needs to pass threw or else he gets plugged up. He has a very restricted diet of exclusively soft food and gets twice daily stool softener medicine to allow everything to flow through fine. We got this all under control about 3 years ago and havent had any major health issues since. Basically now because he has that splint he always feels like he needs to poop and instead of just pooping once he now basically has to do rabbit poops, stopping and squatting several times and only being able release a little at a time.

As far as his bathroom situation goes his entire life when we let him out into the backyard hed go to the right side of the house and do his business in the empty drive way. This was perfect because all the backyard furniture and stuff was on the left side of the house so wed never have to worry about stepping in it or anything.

However over the past few months he has been gradually getting more and more sporadic with where he goes in the backyard where now its to the point where hell go wherever, even right in front of the backdoor sometimes.

Also we know for a fact that hes not doing this because his condition is worsening or because hes getting older. He still never ever goes in the house and is actually the healthiest hes been in years so I believe its just a case of him getting more comfortable going wherever. Its hard to yell at him though because Ive had many sleepless nights with him in a horrible condition from not being able to poop and hes so so emotionally sensitive that if hes yelled at or scolded he doesnt eat and cant poop at all. So I dont want to do anything that could stop him from pooping I just want to have him go in his specific area again.

Can anyone help give me advice on how I can train or coax him to prefer going to the bathroom in the driveway again. I dont want to be to hard on him because hes in a very rough situation and we never actually trained him to go in the driveway he just always did that and it worked out for everyone, so he doesnt actually know its wrong but I think we may be enabling him a bit too much. Is there any tricks or products I can buy to make him prefer going in the driveway again, the backyard is all concrete so Im thinking buying an astroturf potty mat might help but idk.

2023-10-14,1697313013,Tips for overexcitement in giant breed puppies,"I impulsively adopted my boy from a shelter almost two months ago. The shelter told me was a lab/mastiff mix. He was about 55lbs and 4 months old when I adopted him. At 6 months old, hes already taller than his 6yr old golden retriever cousin. While adopting him was not planned, I rearranged my entire life for him and have not regretted a single thing. Hes just the sweetest boy. His size is new for me and raises some questions for me. 

Based on my researchand his humongous pawsI can absolutely tell hell be 100-120 lbs so my main focus is training. Hes not destructive (I think because I try to provide a lot of mental stimulation and walks) but the thing we really need to work on is how excited he gets about people. He LOVES people and can start trying to use his paws and jump due to the amount of excitement filling his body. 

I do take him out to public areas like Starbucks or open parking lots to socialize him with new environments and experiences, but because of his size I really dont want to mess this up and end up with a 100lb+ dog that gets flooded with excitement when we walk passed a person on the street.

* I think that form a day to day basis I would be able to spend up to 1 hour of training a day, I don't know if it amounts to much, I lack experience with training. Other interaction (walks mostly) would amount to 2 hours a day and I live with someone else who would be able to spend as much.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* I'm thinking about walks exclusively but I'm interested in other kind of exercises!

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm open to brushing/cleaning as often as needed but trimming and other ""risky"" work would be made by a professional.

**Personal Preferences** 

10) What size dog are you looking for? 

* From mid-size up to big! Its size doesn't scare me, for obvious reasons I exclude the huge ones and small ones wouldn't fit my preferences.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

* I can handle a lot of barking (my parents own 2 border terrier) but it would need to be as minimal as possible. Regarding shedding, I would prefer it to be not too excessive.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

* Very high, including dog parks and outdoors (far from the city obviously)

**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

* There's never too much hugs

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* I'm not sure of what this question implies, I want it to be obedient but have its own personality.

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

* If no barking is possible then I won't ask for more. A calm personality would be ideal.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

 * nothing else

**Lifestyle** 

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

* We both work during weekdays but are very close (less than 10 minutes walk) so we would passby during lunch hours. I think the dog would be alone for 4-5 hours at a time, up to 2 times a day. So quite a lot, I think it would average around 8 hours a day.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Close to the same, to my knowledge.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* A cat and a ferret. They get along well and can be assertive toward other animals at first.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

* no but I'd like it to be the case.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* no restriction in France regarding renting and animals.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* France, the dogs banned are already excluded from the description.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* down to -5°C and up to 40°C this year (Paris...)

2023-10-14,1697305570,Wanting a dog but can never settle on a dog breed,"Hello me and my husband are looking for a new dog. We live in a 65sqm ground floor apartment with a small courtyard in a semi-rural part of Sweden. We have 2 cats that are used to dogs as we had a dog years ago (A Finnish Lapphund). We are looking for a dog that can chill in the night time while we game but in the daytime can go on an hour walk in the forest. It doesn't need to be a breed recognized by kennel clubs either.   
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
No, we have owned a high-energy dog in the past  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
No preference just needs to be healthy and young  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
A dog that can settle most of the day in the house but when we are outside it needs to be able to keep up on brisk long walks in the forest. Would like a breed that loves to swim and play. It needs to be a medium-sized or small sized dog with medium energy (maybe high energy if its generally a calmer breed)   
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
I like Spaniels because of their love for water but not sure which one matches our lifestyle. I also cant help but love the look of spitz dogs but most seem too intense (but maybe a Eurasier, Pomeranian,Norrbottenspets or a Elo dog).   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
The basics, maybe some nose work, or maybe being a ESA  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
Nope  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
Long walks at least an hour, swimming a lot in the summer, I am not a big fan of the dog park with stranger dogs but when its empty or with familiar dogs then yes.  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
Weekly brushing, ear cleaning and nail clipping im okay with doing and sometimes groomer  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
Small or Medium  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I would love that if a dog could but I know must dogs thats a no go without lots of training  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
Must be snuggly, our last dog was super independent   
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
A mix, eager to please during training but must be able to chill on its own sometimes  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
Barking is okay but I would like a more friendly dog that at least says a small hi

100% just under some control, lunging on the lead would be a mess but I am willing to keep a future dog away that doesnt like other dogs

A lot of mindless barking, never settling, resource guarding  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
I work from home so it would be most days where I am always with the dog but sometimes we do go out for a few hours to shop or drink

2023-10-14,1697294635,Crate training for heartworm treatment- help!,"Looking for some help and advice. I adopted a dog from Louisiana last month, hes heartworm positive. Hes a two year old lab, healthy other than the heartworms. Were following the AHS protocol and hes scheduled to get his first injection in late November. Hes currently crate trained for when were out of the house. Were working on getting him crate trained to be in there at all times, problem is hes freaking out. If Im home and put him in the crate the same way we do when we go out, he loses his mind: jumping, crying, whining, circling around. It doesnt stop even if we ignore him. Hes continued this for over 30 minutes every time and does not calm down. I dont know what to do because I feel like this is going to be way more dangerous for him one he gets the injections. Were trying to get ahead of it now but its been two weeks of trying to slowly increase his crate tolerance and its not been getting any better. He currently eats his meals in the crate and gets treats to go in, he has several toys he likes in there and a kong with peanut butter. He has no interest in any of this if were home. We never force him in, hell go for the treats and toys, but starts getting upset once he eats the initial treat he followed in. Any advice is appreciated! Im really stressing over what to do with him next month = hes on trazedone already and its doing next to nothing.

2023-10-14,1697258428,Reputable Cavapoo Breeder?,"I know that poodle mixes are pretty controversial, but I wanted to get some opinions on this breeder as they seem like a good one? They do health testing on their dogs for the cavalier/poodle genetic diseases, have ECG tests and patellas scores, and are actually in the process of transitioning away from cavapoos to brittany/poodle and springer/poodle mixes due to the inherent genetic issues with the cavalier breed. Would a cavapoo from their remaining breeding cavapoos be a good option?

I'm looking for something in the 15-30 pound range a bit more mellow than a purebreed poodle, but more energy than something like a shih tzu. I have two cats so I don't really want any terrier types.

2023-10-14,1697289827,Any recommendations for a trainable and mediim-energy dog? [Breeds],"*medium, oops

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
Yes it will be my first dog. But I have been a dog sitter for a long time and I have worked with a lot of dogs in my job.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
Reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
Trainable, eager to learn, medium energy, doesn't bark a lot, medium size.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
Eurasiers, rough collies, and corgis due to being trainable however the downside is rough collies and corgis can be vocal.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
All the basics as well as more advanced tricks and being able to go off-leash.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
I would like to have the option to compete in obedience, although as this is my first dog I'll see how things get on. My would be a companion pet and not used for any work. I don't have any experience of competing yet.


**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
Many hours, the dog would get a *lot* of attention and training from both my partner and I.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
1 hour a day and longer on the weekends. Hiking trips and trips to national parks pretty often. But I would not like a super high energy dog that I would feel the need to ""exhaust"", especially if I'm ill for a week and less able to go for walks.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
Happy to do regular brushing and pay for a professional (but probably not regular professional grooming hense why I would not like a dog such as a poodle or poodle mix)  

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
Anything larger than a Pomeranian and smaller than a malamute.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Shedding is fine although I'd prefer less lol. Barking and slobber I can't really handle. I love Shelties but I've heard they're worse for barking than rough collies. If I can train the barking out of the dog it'll be ok, but I hate excessive barking.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
Very important! I don't mind if it takes a while to train of course.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
I'd like a snuggly dog (at least to my partner and I)

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
Eager to please for sure.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
I would prefer my dog to ignore someone knocking the door or entering the yard but the odd bark I know is natural for a lot of dogs and I wouldn't mind that. I don't mind how they greet strangers/visitors as long as they aren't aggresive. I would prefer them to be slightly aloof yet friendly but it's not a big deal.


16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
If it happens it happens and I'll try my best to remedy the situation, but I would not like that if I can avoid it. Early socialisation will be a priority in training for sure.


17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
Barking, aggression, separation anxiety, destructiveness when bored, high prey drive (I don't want my dog attacking squirrels in the garden or chasing cats if I can avoid it)


**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
Mostly up to an hour a day because my partner works from home and can give the dog attention and let them outside. Occasionally up to 8 hours a day if he goes into the office, but I work part time and weekends and he works during the week so it'll probably end up being very rare that the dog is left alone. We could hire someone to come during the day to check up on them and let them outside if necessary.


19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
Two adults with equal involvement with exercise, training, attention, taking them to the vets etc. I will do probaly the majority of the feeding, grooming, and picking up poop.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
No other current pets but I'd love to get another dog or a cat one day.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
Rent and no restrictions

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
UK. Pit bull terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino, and Fila Brasileiro are illegal.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
5°C in winter and 24°C in summer.

I am well versed in caring for dogs, Ive done multiple certificates in different areas of animal care and plan to study Veterinary Nursing next year. I have an older but very lively and fit Maltese Shih Tzu and he would get along with a new dog so that wouldnt be an issue. I really want a dog to care for and train another animal besides my family dog, for him to have other dog company, etc. I live with my parents but they plan to move out within 1-2 years and Ive got reasonable savings for someone my age. The only concern especially from my parents is that when I move out Ill struggle a lot more to find a rental that allows pets. I would only get a small dog, either another Maltese Shih Tzu or an Italian Greyhound. Do you think its okay to get a puppy or should I really wait until things are more secure in a year or two? My family definitely have a good point but they tend to be pessimistic and stringent rather than supportive of something that would benefit me in many ways.

Once it gets dark, he turns into a rabid hysterical guard dog for an hour or two. I have gone out there a couple times with a flashlight and then noticed that there are bunnies just sitting there beyond our fence staring at us&

Hell stay outside until we basically force him in and then once hes back in he scratches at the back door after a few minutes to go back out. does this until hes literally out of energy and then has like a hangover the next day. Starting to think that its not good for his health.

We do walk him once or twice a day, and gets plenty of exercise but maybe its not enough. 

He does have a strong prey reflex when we see smaller animals like squirrels, foxes etc on walks, but this is really another level. hes the most loving cuddly dog like 99% of the time but if theres a bunny or anything beyond our fence he goes into predator mode and will almost bite me if I try to touch him when hes in this mode.

I have 2 Newfoundlands that are well socialized with other dogs and we have fostered before so they have experience with new dogs coming and going. My youngest of the two is more sensitive and I really saw that when I decided to adopt my 8 year old basset hound foster. 

We are at the 3 month mark now and when she first arrived she was terrified of my 126lb newfy. It was obvious from the start she had never seen a dog that large and it took her almost a month to realize hes harmless. My other boy is 85lbs and dogs tend to gravitate towards him more. I hadnt realized when bringing my basset in that he had become a little withdrawn. He ate and drank normal, theyre all older so theres not much play, but within this last week he has started jumping on the couch again and resting. How have I not noticed he was avoiding sitting the couch for 2 months? Now that Im aware of it, it feels so nice to see him be able to fully relax and embrace his new sibling. 

So not only did it take 3 months for my basset to get adjusted to our schedule, it took me 3 months to learn about how she works, and it took my existing dogs 3 months to return to their normal 100% nonchalanceokay, my biggest one is oblivious to the rest of the world so he doesnt count.",dogs,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/177rxzg/333_rule_is_applies_to_more_than_your_new_rescue/

Yesterday, I lost my sweet girl. She was going to be 12 in December, a mama of five, and she and her baby were inseparable - what mama did, so did baby, and when mama slept, baby was with her for the last eight years.

It happened so quickly. She was fine on Wednesday. Then all of a sudden, she wasn't able to stand up yesterday morning, had a high temp, fell unconscious in the late afternoon, and passed away peacefully in her home with all of us around her.

My heart is in pieces. Every day for the last 18 months she was by my side constantly, would be the first one to greet me when I came home, ate by my hand, spent the most time with me and quite frankly, was the one who got me through the trauma of losing my first child. Now I've lost another, and I've lost myself again.

I'm so done with life. I have a suspicion it was cancer just like my first boy, because it all happened the exact same way. I want to think that we gave her the best life and she felt love from all of us every single day, and I'll see her and my sweet prince again.

He was a lot more cuddly than usual and seemed to need reassurance. He'd run out of the room every time anyone tried to move her (she lost pretty much all muscle mass in her legs and couldn't stand or walk on her own towards the end). He was in the room when she took her final breath but he'd sort of squeezed himself into the farthest corner away from her body.  
They were sort of bonded? They grew up together since they were both puppies and always seemed to.... tolerate being together, but they also had zero issues being apart.

My girlfriend and I recently rescued a year old Shepherd / Akita Mix (we named him Cruiser). He's been with us for approximately 2 days now and he's been great besides a few things. Our first night, we kinda ""failed"" crate training, as much as we made his crate seem awesome; he truly was not a great fan of it and was terrified, so he slept on the living room floor with us on the couch to keep him company. Fast forward a day or so, I've been trying to do 5-10 minute intervals in the crate and every time, he goes bonkers. I once left him for about 10-20 minutes to run an errand and he barked and cried the entire time. 

I only have a little less than a week that I took off to be with Cruiser until I head back to work (8-9hr shifts / 3 days a week) and I'm questioning on how to tackle his cries beforehand. A few things to note:

1) We live in an apartment. I'm planning on talking and giving my neighbors a heads up that he currently is in training and it won't be forever but I still want to be courteous with his barks. 

2) Cruiser is pretty mellow dude; I'd like to say I got lucky because he typically does not care for biting and destroying things but I don't want to jinx myself. Due to his age, do you think it's viable for me to let him free-roam during those working hours?

3) I continuously want to crate train him. Is a play-pen connected to his cage a good method to take?

4) Cage or not, how do I help mitigate his cries when we're not home?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The last time I picked a puppy from a litter was the family dog which died around 15 years ago at nearly 15 years old (RIP Sasha the Mini Fox Terrier). My wife and I adopted a medium sized shelter dog a little under 12 years ago and he is still going well (albeit with monthly arthritis injections). We call him a pure-bred mutt because who knows what breed he really is! The point is, he's nearly 30kg (66lb).

We have the opportunity to pick a Maltese x Shitzu puppy tomorrow and will be visiting the breeder at their home to do so. Specifically related to the puppies what should I be on the look out for?

* The breeder is a trusted co-worker but we will assess the living conditions of the dogs
* We have the breeders permission to  take our 12yo dog to meet the puppies
* We have a 4.5yo daughter who we are surprising with the new puppy *IF* we buy one. She wont be with us tomorrow but will obviously love the puppy
* Senior dog is dominant, definitely not submissive and he's just an old man who sleeps most of the day and night

We are already planning to introduce the puppy to the senior dog very slowly over the course of 2 weeks or so. My plan is to bring puppy home but give senior dog to in-laws for a week. Then swap them for a day or two (supervised interactions in between) before re-introducing the puppy to the home with the senior dog for supervised interactions for a week. All meals will be strictly separated at first and the senior dog will always eat first.

Is there anything else I should consider with puppy selection and/or puppy introduction to the home?

We lost our dog, Saki, on Aug 22. It was rather sudden. Since then, we've had some issues with our other dog, Ada. They weren't super close, but Ada did care for Saki. She is a rescue and we've had her about 4.5 years. We think she's about 8 years old. 

Anyway, since Saki's passing, we have tried to keep to their schedule as much as we can for Ada. We've had to alter it a little, but Ada does best in a routine and she doesn't like when it changes *at all*. We know she's been grieving and we've tried to work with that as well. We're also grieving, so we get it.

Since Saki passed, Ada has stopped eating from her bowl. At first we thought it was because we'd moved her bowl. So we moved it back to it'snormal spot. That worked for about a day. We tried a plate and she ignored the food. She'll eat her food if we hand-feed her (we're trying to avoid that) and she'll eat when we put her food on the floor. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tried and true tips or advice? We don't want to add toppers or anything to encourage her eating because she grows accustomed to that very quickly.

We loved her but she just wasnt compatible with our life and she was struggling as a result. All we wanted was for her to be happy and for us to get our life back - she was reactive and fear aggressive so we couldnt have people over easily, couldnt let her off the lead (even in the garden due to aggressive barking), separation anxiety so couldnt be left alone for very long at all without tearing up the sofa and other things, she was also a terrible resource guarder and would attack our other dog regularly and he became fearful of her when food etc was around (but they would also play lots too). 
After our baby came her behaviours escalated and the management of it all was near enough impossible and i honestly became very depressed and anxious trying to cope.
So we made the very painful decision for the rescue to take her back to give her a chance to find the right home for her, and also to try to have a change of environment as maybe ours was not right for her (the behaviourist said this could be the case too) 
Its been a number of weeks now and Im STILL struggling with it and worry Ill never get over it, I keep thinking shes coming back and miss her so much. I think about the day she left and how upset we were and feel it all over again.

2023-10-13,1697210385,Tips for keeping a dog entertained while we're away at work?,"Hi all,

We recently adopted a 1.5yr old golden from a rescue and overall he's been a great dog so far (zero leash manners though wowza). He's home alone for about 6 hours a day where my partner and my work schedules overlap. He's free out in the house which is what I prefer since he's crated at night; I want him to have as much out of crate time as possible.

The main problem we've got right now is that he's started to tear up things in the recycle bin and snag things off the counter when we're gone. I know the easy answer is get a different style bin he can't get into and clear the counters, which we are doing, but I worry he's doing it because he's bored during the day.

We give his food in a snuffle mat, freeze baby food or peanut butter in a toppel toy and a lick mat and he gets one of those as we leave the house but I think it only lasts him between 15-20 minutes max. 

He gets as long of a sniffy walk as we can do in the morning before work (25-30min) and a longer one when we get home in the evening. He's not crazy high energy, when we're home he usually is content to be near us playing with one of his toys or just sleeping cuddled up next to us, so I don't know if he's bored at home during the day or just lonely?

I'm just not sure what else we can incorporate to keep him busy during the day so he doesn't feel the inclination to start getting into stuff he shouldn't.

I'm not sure how people afford to do doggy daycare or have a dog walker every day (the absolute cheapest I can find on Rover is 10$/walk, which is $200/month if we do it every single day - kind of a bigger monthly expense than I feel comfortable adding on right now). Can anyone offer tips? I almost feel guilty that we got a dog when neither of us work from home but millions of people have dogs and have normal jobs right?

So I have two dogs I'm a stay-at-home wife. So me and my dogs are together 100% of the time. We both rescued them when they were about 7 months old. And we live in a one-bedroom apartment. So every single morning I take them on a mile walk on the trail near our apartment. I do that every single morning sometimes in the afternoon too, and then we do a shorter quick walk in the evening but sometimes we do the trail in the evening as well. And that's their routine. And one of our dogs is a coonhound so she's pretty lazy and doesn't like to play as much she just likes to sit next to you while you pet her. But my other dog is a pitbull mix and she's always wanted to play tug of war she's always wanting to wrestle with me. She is literally always by my side. She sleeps in bed next to me, the Pitbull always wants to be right on top of me at all times basically. 

  
   And I recently had a terrible back injury. I've never had an injury like this before in my entire life. I slipped a disc and literally couldn't even really walk for a month. And obviously I can't walk the dogs so my husband's been having to take them on short walks in the mornings and evenings. I've also been having to sleep in the recliner so the dogs can't sleep with me. And it's been about 8 weeks now and I still can't really walk them or play with them and I'm still in the recliner even though I'm a lot better.


  Do my dogs understand that it's because I'm hurt? Do they think I don't love them anymore and that's why I'm not taking them outside anymore? It's really stressing me out. The Pitbull keeps bringing me her toys trying to get me to play tug of war and I just can't. They keep looking at me and asking to go out and expecting me to take them. And it just seems like they've given up even asking me now and it just breaks my heart.

Ive had another dog on crate rest in the past in a wire kennel, but theyre very exposed. She was crate trained but hasnt been crated in many years, so I think we will be starting over aside from the positive association the Ruffland has with fun. 

Does anybody have experience with both? Was there one that seemed to be preferred? She is an anxious, insecure dog so Im leaning toward the Ruffland, but its so closed off.

Our dog loves both of us, and we both love her. She isn't partial to one of us in particularshe has more separation anxiety from me since I'm most often the one who feeds and walks her (just a matter of work schedules), but she's way more affectionate, cuddly, and playful with my ex. She's truly at her happiest and goofiest when we're all together, which is heartbreaking, but it is what it is.

We decided that she'll stay with whoever stays with the house  so, in this case, me. Things ended amicably, so we're likely to keep in touch regardless. 

How have you navigated this in the past? Things have always been 50/50 in terms of expenses, and she's registered in both of our names. Should the departing pet parent pay dog child support (his suggestion)? Did you arrange some sort of regular visitation/playdate setup? Is that best held in a neutral public place or in the home she's already familiar with?

I want to make sure she and my ex still have access to each other and can maintain their bond, while also being fair to the need for space/grieving process we'll both be going through once he leaves. The part of me that wants to reconcile also hopes this can keep positive interactions up and help on that front, lol (edit: my ex said hes open to it, its not some hidden ulterior motive!)

I have had asthma my whole life but it was never severe, in fact the first time I used an inhaler was at the age of 17 due to a stupid decision on my part to start smoking cigarettes.
After this, every time I would quit smoking my asthma would become dormant again and I would have no problems. But nicotine addiction is hard to permanently quit so I went back and forth with cigs during my early twenties. I am 27 now.

About 1 year ago two events happened simultaneously: I quit smoking and my family adopted a dog.

The first two months were pretty good but after that, during January, my asthma started getting progressively bad. To the point that since the end of April it has become chronically bad, meaning something I suffer every single day.
I have done an allergy test and it was confirmed I am mildly allergic to dogs, which I had already suspected. 
Im sick of being constantly out of breath and have seriously considered finding another home for my beloved dog as I cannot imagine continually living my life this way.

I bought a HEPA air filter, my dog does not enter my bedroom and these measures still havent improved my situation significantly.

I repeat every single day of my life since the end of April Ive been having breathing issues.

Please give me your thoughts. Is there a way out of this besides finding another shelter for my dog?",dogs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/176n5a2/dog_allergies_and_asthma/

2023-10-12,1697154194,It's ok to not be obsessed with your dog right away.,"Just something I've been reflecting on lately since my dog turned three yesterday. When I first got my dog as a puppy, I loved him, but it was hard to like him sometimes. I wondered if we'd ever truly experience that strong bond that some people have with their dogs. 

Often just when it felt like we were connecting, he'd go through a bratty phase and I'd have to re-teach him everything again. I'd feel relieved when my parents took him for a weekend, just for a break from walks and constant supervision. But I stayed dedicated to our relationship and did whatever I could to help him grow into a happy, healthy, well-adjusted dog.

Then about six months ago or so, it clicked for me. I got it. That maternal obsession that people have for their dogs? Where they swear their dog is their literal, biological child that they'd do anything for? That's me now. We're inseparable, and it feels like our bond goes deeper than just dog and owner. There's real, deep trust and love there, on both ends. I know it's sappy, lol. But all the hard work paid off. He's a sweet, well-adjusted, well-mannered boy who seems to understand me in the same way I understand him. He has the absolute best personality now and it's hard to imagine getting another dog because they'd never be able to replace him. 

It might be obvious, but your dog's personality doesn't fully develop until they're well past the teenage stage. If you don't really like your puppy yet, don't give up. Obviously not every dog is right for every owner, but just thought I'd share in case you're in a good situation but haven't developed that inseparable bond yet. It's probably on it's way.

2023-10-12,1697141063,I dont think my dogs personality is compatible with my mental health and I dont know what to do,"Will try to keep this concise

A month ago my gf and I adopted a dog privately from a family that needed to rehome her. She came from a  big house with multiple kids and other dogs, to our house of two with no other dogs.

Wed vetted thoroughly from the start for anxiety because Im diagnosed with GAD, CPTSD, OCD, and have a history of depression. My hope was to find a dog with a good temperament to eventually train as a sort of emotional support / service animal for panic attacks and stuff. But even if that wasnt feasible at the very least I wanted a dog that didnt have anxiety issues. The owners assured us six ways to Sunday that she had none.

Well you can probably guess where this is going. She has behavioral issues that make it challenging to impossible to leave the house. She freaks out the whole time we are gone. Shes also had issues in other areas but weve tried our best to make concessions for her, like letting her in the bedroom when we wanted her to sleep elsewhere.

Weve tried crate training and activity toys and treats and soothing music and calming treats and playing videos and heartbeat dolls etc etc etc.

Im not gonna get into it all but its been a struggle. Weve barely been able to leave the house.

But the salt on the wound for me has become that shes just, not very affectionate with me. She doesnt seem to have an instinct to comfort or be near me if Im dealing with anxiety or pain, and even beyond that in general, I just cant seem to get her to truly bond with me. Ive had dogs in the past and never had issues. I feel like she mostly tolerates me, and she is very stubborn and getting her to listen can be very challenging sometimes.

I know she was the boss of the other dogs in her last home. I often feel like shed be happier in a more busy home like the one she came from, with another dog to keep her company when the humans are out. I try so hard to bond but the genuine connection just doesnt seem to be there.

I wanted a dog again to add to my life, to help soothe me when I am struggling. Instead I am stressed all the time, feel trapped, and lonely when I am struggling and she wont show me any affection.

I know it hasnt been long but the longer I wait the harder it gets to think of finding her a better home, because I do love her. And the thought of saying goodbye is heartbreaking. Shes so cute and so soft and so quirky but her lack of affection and anxiety/behavioral issues are really negatively affecting me. And I feel like the longer I wait to decide the more pain Im causing for myself and her if it doesnt work. A local certified foster network rescue would take her and find her a great home if we go that route, but I just dont know what to do. I dont know whats right.

Even if we can break the behavioral issues, if shes never truly affectionate with me and bonded to me it will hurt so much and I cant bare it. I think shes bonded more to my partner, because she is more stable. I feel like because of my mental health issues she will never bond with me. Are some dogs just not a good fit personality wise for people with mental health issues? 

Is it reasonable to feel this way? To feel like she and I would both be happier with her in a different kind of home? Please help, and please be gentle, I am hurting.",dogs,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/176g1ce/i_dont_think_my_dogs_personality_is_compatible/

I'd consider myself an absolute beginner, but dog training has been my special interest for about twenty years now so I do have an awful lot of knowledge if not hands-on experience. I've also dog-sat for month-long stretches and helped train (developing a training plan, helping them decide how to address problem behaviors, going over three times a week to help things stay on track/work on leash) my sister's border collie mix pup. (Border collie/poodle/berner mix according to Embark, and then a surprise human nephew happened, which is why I was asked to be so involved. It was nice finding out that my theoretical knowledge did in fact work when applied!)  

  
**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?**  
\*Reputable breeder. I'm already in contact with the breeder I'll choose if I decide to go for it. 

  
**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
\* Medium to large. Intelligent and with a good drive for training/whatever dog sport they end up liking best, but with a reliably trained off switch. Cuddly, affectionate, and responsive to their person's moods. Active is good - I plan for this dog to be my main ""hobby"" - but with a little less of the goofy energy of boxers and some labs I've known. Neutral to neutral-positive about strange people and dogs out in the world with proper socialization. 

  
**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
\* As mentioned, I'm mainly interested in a GSD as I've had excellent experiences with them throughout my life, their personality seems like a good fit for what I'm looking for, and I've done a lot of research into them. However, I'd be open to other suggestions and there are a few other breeds (particularly tollers) that I love but don't seem as closely aligned to what I want from a dog. 

  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
\*I plan to train for Canine Good Citizen, and obviously want to build a strong foundation in the basics (including a solid recall), but beyond the basics I'm more interested in training in and of itself than specific behaviors/tricks. I've got a long list of potential behaviors/tricks, sure, but the idea would be to see which of them would best interest/challenge/work to the strengths of whatever my future dog ends up being like. 

  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
\* I definitely want to be involved in some kind of dog sport, but it doesn't particularly matter to me which one so I'm happy to see what seems to work best for my future dog. I don't have any experience in dog sports (beyond knowledge of them) but I do know people who compete in rally, Mondio Ring, and dock-diving who are excited to help get me involved, even if it's not in their current sport of choice. 

  
**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***  
**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
\*I'm specifically looking for a hobby dog, so 'a large portion of my non-working time' is the best answer I can give here. Extrapolating from the time I've spent dog-sitting, that would usually work out to 4-6 hours a day on most days. 

  
**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
\*No dog parks. The exact schedule for physical exercise would depend on the dog's needs, but my placeholder schedule for when the dog is grown would be one 1-2 hour walk, two 30 minutes-1 hour walks (for a total of at least 2.5 hours most days) and plenty of fetch/flirt pole both during the walks and at home. The walks would probably be a combination of structured/sniffy and fast/slow and would mostly take place in the large natural areas I'm lucky to live nearby.   
If I was unable to go for long walks - I have a disability that's mostly well-managed but can flare up a couple of times a year, and everyone gets sick - I'd rely on a combination of hired dog walkers, long sessions in a natural open area with a long line for sniffing/flirt pole/fetch, and increased mental exercise. 

  
**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
\*I've done a lot of research into cooperative care and am happy to do plenty of at-home grooming (even already own a secondhand nail dremel from a friend who got a new one for Christmas). Most of the breeds I'm interested in don't ""need"" professional grooming in the same way some breeds do, but I'd still plan to take my future dog in at least twice a year to keep them comfortable with the process and help with shedding etc, especially if I end up with a GSD. 

  
**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***  
**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
\* Medium to large.

  
**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
Shedding is fine (or I wouldn't be looking at GSDs). Barking to alert is fine/expected, but I'd want to be able to train a 'that's enough' cue; nuisance barking would be less great but I know that's a combination of personality/circumstances that might pop up and need to be worked on/with. Slobber is basically my least favorite part about dogs, lol. Comes with the territory but I can't handle dogs with really wet mouths, like mastiffs. 

  
**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
\*Important, but I know it's a process to get there and I'm happy to keep future dog on a long drag line until their recall is actually reliable - however long that takes. 

  
**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***  
**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
\*Definitely snuggly, though I wouldn't be heartbroken or anything if the dog ends up wanting more space. 

  
**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**  
\*Eager to please for sure, and I love a velcro dog, but I'd also put the work into making sure they also know how to just hang out on their own when necessary. 

  
**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
\*Alert barking to visitors is fine/expected, and initial standoffishness is also fine, but I'd want them to be able to relax once introduced. Neutral to neutral-positive would be the goal. 

  
**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
\* Willing, sure, but I'd like to avoid it if possible and I'm definitely focused on breeders who prioritize a level disposition. I also plan to socialize the future pup properly and avoid places where dog vs dog conflict is more likely (ie dog parks) to improve the odds on aggression/reactivity. 

  
**17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
\*Most of the behaviors I can think of are ones that can be trained out, or would be my fault if they occurred. Separation anxiety is trickier, since I know the type of dog I'm interested in often has a tendency towards it - plus, I work from home. I really don't want to deal with SA, and I'm happy to put in the training/scheduled time out of the house/etc to try to avoid it, but I know it's a possibility even with those measures in place. 

  
**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***  
**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
\*I live alone and work from home, so unless I make the decision to leave (in a controlled way to help future dog get used to being alone) I'm there all day, every day, aside from grocery shopping and other short errands. The max time future dog would spend alone would probably be three or four hours if I had a doctor's appointment across the city or something. 

  
**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
\* I live alone, though I might be moving in with a friend in a few years. They love dogs, we've talked about what it would look like and they've expressed that they'd be happy to love on/play with the pup, and occasionally take over daily duties if I was sick, but are otherwise happy to be the fun aunt and leave the work to me lol. 

  
**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**  
\*There's a small but real chance that my friend I might move in with might also get a dog, likely a sighthound of some kind. If she does, we'd see how the dogs get along before making the final decision on whether to move in together. If we don't move in together, I'd like a cat one day but I don't mind that being extremely dependent on how future pup behaves around them.

  
**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
\*Yes, my nephew who I see a few times a month. He's being raised to behave appropriately around dogs since his family's the one with the border collie mix, but I'd still make sure - and so would my sister - to keep them separated or highly supervised until he's older and both he and the dog can be trusted. 

  
**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
\*Own my own place, no restriction. 

  
**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
\*Canada, no bans on dogs in my area. 

  
**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
\*Very temperate climate, the average ranges from 3.5 to 18 degrees celsius (38-64 degrees fahrenheit), with occasional frozen spells and heat waves.

Did it help?,"My wife and I took our 3 year old chihuahua mix to a doggy day care to help get her socialized more. She is a very shy and timid and has never been very friendly with other dogs. She doesnt fight them or anything, she avoids them at all cost. There are a few friends who have dogs who she is fine with and tolerates, but not new dogs. We are hoping that this will help her feel more comfortable with other dogs and maybe even a bit more playful. 

The day care has a webcam and we are watching her and shes hiding in the corner underneath one of the ramp toys and shes not coming out.

Edit: thanks for all the responses. After a couple hours she did pop out of her hiding spot and walked around a bit and interacted with the other dogs. The trainers gave her some love and she was doing ok. It helped that there were only about five other dogs in the room and they were all small like her.

2023-10-12,1697079424,Struggles in looking for a dog,"Hi!

I've been looking to adopt a dog for a few months now, and I wanted to share feelings on the experience, and see if reddit had any advice on those feelings.

I live in the PNW, and have been searching shelters since about August. I log onto the websites most days before the shelters open, and try to leave to get there at opening if a dog is of interest. So far, i've struck out. There's often a long line, multiple interested adoptees, and a lot of stress in the whole process.

A lot of dogs come through these shelters, and I'm looking for a companion that can be around for a while. I don't have a specific breed requirement, but am finding that the features, age, and temperament of dogs I'm interested in, is pretty much the standard. Everyone wants these dogs, and they can be gone within an hour of the shelter listing them, others stick around for days/weeks. 

I feel like a choosing beggar sometimes, that I should settle for a dog still in the shelter. But, many of them are strays from Mexico or Texas, have poor socialization, and would take a ton of work to be able to even walk on a leash. They are often listed as not able to be around kids, which my dog would need to be around kids sometimes, as I have family with small children. I have experience in training and keeping a dog behaved and exercised, and know that many of the dogs that stay in the shelter would not be a good fit. But it doesn't stop this guilty feeling of passing by opportunity, or trying to train one to be a decent fit.

I've looked into the responsible/ethical breeder route and felt pretty bad about prices in the $3-4k range, while this isn't impossible to afford, it would be a big expense. I've spread my search net to more distant shelters. Every option just feels so difficult. I've adopted from these same shelters twice before in my life, 10-20 years ago, and it never felt this bad in terms of availability. In the past i've been able to walk in with little no planning and find a dog. I don't feel like my standards have gone up, it really feels like availability of calmer temperament dogs is just so much lower. 

What else can I do here? Am I correct that adopting has just gotten this much harder? Am I expecting too much from a shelter dog?

Any advice or shared experience is welcome, Thank you.

2023-10-16,1697483959,How do you train a dog to not do something that its never done before?,"Hopefully that question makes sense, but tomorrow my husband and I are picking up a puppy we are rescuing from a puppy mill. Weve been told by her foster that she is very timid and enjoys being in her crate. We have never crated our dogs before and just taught them to not chew on shoes or other random things they shouldnt chew after they had already done so. We would block off rooms while we were gone but had some slip ups here and there when our dog would get ahold of a shoe. We always would say no, bad girl or something along those lines and did not have an issue past the first year or so.

2023-10-16,1697481192,"Rant: Im tired of seeing poorly behaved, poorly socialized dogs at restaurant/cafe patios!","Hear me out: I love seeing a well behaved dog at dog friendly bars, restaurants and cafe spaces. As someone with a dog who goes to these places I know it takes a lot of work between training and exposure to have a polite dog who will be successful at these places. 

Im also someone who has been in the service industry for a long time (bartender) and serviced many people with their pet companions I unfortunately run into way more poorly behaved, not appropriately socialized dogs (hell I have been bitten badly by a dog that turned out to have already been deemed an aggressive dog by animal control for another incident while working at a restaurant) at these places. I dont want to gate keep or make people feel poorly about their dogs or themselves, but really want to encourage everyone to make sure their dogs are going to be successful in these spaces. Most of the dog friendly places Ive worked at have actually rescinded their status of being dog friendly and I have a feeling this is going to become more common due to people bringing dogs that just arent adjusted/trained for the environment. 

Ive had so many dog parents when Im sitting with my dog under my feet allow their dogs to drag them over to us to try and say hello. Their dogs wont settle, some of them will bark and bellow the entire time they are at the venue. They will walk up and try to greet or bark at every person passing by. They jump on the table trying to eat scraps or servers when they are trying to take orders. They are never appropriately restrained so some of them are wondering around the place or on a long line with the entire length available to them. Its a lot and its not okay behavior for a dog in that setting. Its annoying and at times dangerous for people/dogs in the area be it a dog knocking someone over, biting them, knocking plates out of servers arms,  a dog getting stepped on or starting a fight with another dog (Ive seen all of these!) 

I really think these spaces can be fun and beneficial for some dogs and dont want to see them disappear due to some bad eggs and/or ignorant pet owners. I personally have a dog who was originally incredibly reactive on the hyper social spectrum. He wanted to greet everyone. He loves interacting with people and absolutely loves playing with other dogs. I had to do a lot of training to get him in a place where he enjoyed settling around stimulating environments. Prior to that he did not get patio access and up until his behavior was basically bomb broof I had contingencies to keep him under threshold. Things like mat work in all different environments, always tying him up away from guest, servers, walkways. Paying my check and having my food out in a Togo as soon as I ordered, starting in low volume times and staying only for 2-5 minutes and building from there. Simulating restaurant experience at home. Ordering ahead of time, asking for a seat (I still tip my serving staff) so my dog isnt in the environment for too long. Its a lot but it reflects in how well mannered and adjusted he is now. 


For him once his behavior was under control going to cafes/bars was incredibly enriching. I wanted him to get the benefits of being social but without having to interact with everything. I worked on a lot of impulse behavior training and behavior modification and now one of his favorite daily activities is sitting on the cafe patio watching people pass by and say hello to him (he doesnt greet but loves the attention) while I treat him. He doesnt react to dogs and he will sometimes do his engagement training by our seat to proof his behaviors even more. Same with popping by my job and hanging out politely on the patio while the regulars reinforce petting him only while he is settled on his mat and given a greet cue. 

Again I dont want to be a Debbie downer or gate keep these spaces but please work up to bringing dogs to these spaces ahead of time. Make sure a dog has a concrete settle. Make sure their temperament is suitable for the space they are in. A nervous, easily excited, high arousal or fearful dog may not be a suitable patio dog or may need a lot of behavior modification prior to bringing to these places. 

I know I am likely preaching to the choir as people on these subreddits are more likely to be more responsible, thoughtful owners, but for those of you thinking about bringing your dog to these places please start from foundations. Work your way up so everyone in the environment including you and your dog are having a great time. If you have friends/family members who are really lax with their dogs but attempt to bring them to these places encourage them to do more training first, or leave the dog at home or opt for a picnic instead. 

Also for people on the fence about patio access for their individual dog , having a dog on a patio is not a flex/hallmark of good pet parent, a needed goal or even  a necessary activity for most if not all dogs. Dont feel as if a dog has to be able to succeed on a patio or restaurant to be a well mannered or well trained dog. Dogs cant miss what they dont know. Dogs also have their own preferences and what some dogs might fun enjoyable can be stressful for other dogs. Enjoy your time with your dog but if its in a public space just make sure your dog has the correct manners and/or management for everyone to have enjoyable, safe time.

2023-10-15,1697413304,Question About Dog Meeting New Kittens,"Hi all,

I have a 7 year old dog who moved into my apartment yesterday (along with my boyfriend, for context), and I have 10-week-old kittens. The dog is ~ 50% Black Lab, ~ 30% Vizsla, and ~ 20% Malinois. (The kittens are orange and have no breed hahaha). 

He saw the kittens through their carrier and barked at them but wasnt interested after we distracted him. They were also hissing and spitting cuz this is the first dog theyve ever met, so I dont think that helped.

Since their first meeting (the carrier was locked and I was holding it so the kittens were never in a situation where they could have gotten physically hurt), Ive put them in my bedroom while the dog acclimated to the apartment, and the dog is not allowed in the bedroom indefinitely.

Ive read articles about generally how to acclimate kittens to dogs, and how they might not be able to meet face-to-face without a barrier of some sort until theyre a bit bigger. 

But based on his breed mix and his age, does anyone have advice on extra things to consider?",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/178sf76/question_about_dog_meeting_new_kittens/

2023-10-16,1697476896,Is it possible to have a chill yet active dog?,"\*\*I would like to get a dog one day, preferably adopted at post-adolescence. I want them to be my companion in hiking/bushwhacking specifically, but I want them to have a calm energy that doesn't overwhelm me.\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* Not my first dog. Lots of experience training. My first one was extremely high energy, very smart, and had very little chill, especially outside of the house. They were extremely intense about everything they did which was a horrible contrast to my usual calm, gentle energy.  
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I would prefer to go through a reputable breeder. Since I do not want a puppy, I know it won't be easy to go this route. I just had a really bad experience the last time I adopted and am too traumatized to try that again (was lied to about the breed/personality, rescue refused to take them back).

I might be interested in foster-to-adopt situation, just really apprehensive to go this route again.  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* I want this dog to act as an emotional support animal. Goofy and enjoys playing around with me (chase, hide and seek etc), but not high strung. I want them to be chill and ideally cuddly (my last dog was extremely high alert and anxious, even around the house - it was very tough on me). However, I want to be able to take this dog hiking with me. They have to be easily trained to be off-leash reliable because that's the majority of trails in my area and it's not safe to have your dog on-leash on the treacherous mountain terrain I hike on. This means I want them to be somewhat velcro, and have minimal prey drive. Ideally they should be minimally interested or completely uninterested in other dogs/people. I'd also like for them to be 40lbs or less.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* Possibly interested in herding breeds since I know they like to be close, but nothing with crazy energy like aussies/border collies. I grew up with shelties and really enjoyed them, but not sure if they'd make a good hiking dog with all their fur.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* Hike off-leash, truffle hunt, possibly be an emotional support dog who would comfort me when I am struggling.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* In a way, I consider being a good hiking companion a job for a dog. Beyond that, truffle hunting would be amazing too. I tried to train my last dog like this, but they struggled too much with high arousal.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* On hike days (\~5 times a week), several hours. On non-hike days, maybe an hour or so.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* \~1 hour a day unless we are hiking as per the above. Not into dog parks, too much risk.  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I'm good with whatever.  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* Medium. Ideally around 30lbs.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* Minimal is ideal, but not a deal breaker.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* EXTREMELY. Most important thing aside from their general energy.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behaviour\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* Snuggly all the way.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* I want them to stick by me like glue, but also be okay to be left alone for a few hours from time to time.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* Calm excitement is okay. Indifference is also fine.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* NO. They can be aloof, but not aggressive at all.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* Aggression, reactivity, over-alertness and high arousal are definitely on my 'do not want' list. Being overly independent is undesirable to me as well.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* I work from home, so not often. Maybe 3-5hrs at a time tops, but ideally I want to take the dog with me.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* Same preferances as mine. They'll also pitch in.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* I'd also like a cat or two one day. Maybe another dog.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* No.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* I rent, but I will not be getting a dog until I own a place with a yard.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* Canada. No breed restrictions in my area.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* Summer: upwards to 30 Celsius. Winter: around 0 Celsius at worst.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
\* I don't have access to friend/family dogs for my dog to hangout with, so if it's necessary they have to be okay in a daycare. But, ideally I want the dog to be content just hanging out with me.

My greatest motivator for wanting a dog like this are seeing others on trails/local groups. They stick by their owners off-leash on long hikes and even NAP in the middle of hikes, on summits, etc. That would be my dream dog.  
  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

Not sure if a dog that can hike 20km+ up mountains can actually be chill/calm/relaxed. I understand it sounds like two conflicting desires, so please call me out if it's not possible. I am fairly sure it is possible though, as I have seen dogs like this in person. However, they were mixed breeds, so I think ultimately they just got lucky. If there is a specific breed who fits the bill, I'd love to learn more about them.",dogs,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/179bd30/is_it_possible_to_have_a_chill_yet_active_dog/

By the time she started showing symptoms (regurgitation and labored breathing) we rushed her to the hospital. She died there before they could do surgery. She was only 1 year and 4 months and she was such an Angel. Her name was Chichi. Her brother Toast is 2; they werent bonded and Toast seems okay but I think he will eventually figure it out. It just was so out of nowhere, one minute she was perfectly fine and then all of a sudden she couldnt breathe out of nowhere.

Im just so heartbroken. We only had her for 10 months but it feels like we had her forever.

Refused to give my money back and I foolishly paid a half price deposit over cashapp. Disputed the charge and reported the accounts via cashapp and Facebook. Doubt anything will come of it and I'm sure my money is gone but it is what it is.

I was looking for a dachshund puppy for my mom. She is disabled and lives with me (21M). I work a lot to support the both of us and she gets horribly lonely. When I get home all I want to do is rest and decompress and I feel bad about that. 

I wanted to get her a companion, as her own ESA passed away due to a sudden health issue about 4 monthd ago. I believe it was a rapid growth wrapped around her liver that had ruptured and was causing her to bleed internally. Vet said only a handful of dogs made it out of the procedure in her 16 years of experience and she was suffering so we put her down to cross the rainbow bridge. 

I suppose what im asking is where could I find a reputable breeder? And what signs should I be on the lookout for? The scammer had a bunch of videos of the same dogs with the same home in the backgrounds etc. It was very convincing aside from a few small red flags that I pushed off as me just being neurotic, as i really just wanted to do something good for my mom. 

I don't have much money. Even less after the scam. I seldom get to save between both of our ordinary expenses and her special expenses due to her dietary restrictions because she has the gastrointestinal issue of a pinhole sized stricture. She can only eat stuff like sauces, soups, spray cheese and ice cream and that adds up.

2023-10-16,1697468840,Dad is making my puppy live outside,"My puppy is scared of my dad. When we first got him at 4-5 months, he would growl and run away from him (we suspect the people we got him from were not very nice to him, since hes scared of almost every new person he comes into contact with, men and women alike). 

My dad got angry at this very quickly since he has a short temper and would yell at the dog against everyone in my family telling him not to. He didnt stop and it made the situation worse. 

We have tried everything we can to train my puppy to stop growling within my budget but nothing works. He goes through phases of not growling or barking and being fine around my dad to suddenly being scared and growling again. 

When we take him places in the car with my dad my puppy is very friendly towards him and will rest his head on my dads arm or run up to him to say hello excitedly on walks, but when we get home he gets scared again. 

My puppy has even gone into my dads bedroom and curled up next to him and napped with him, then the very same day growling and running outside to get away whenever my dad walked into the same room.

My Jack Russel is now 7 months old, and my dad has banished him out of the house and he sleeps and eats outside. I take him on at least 2 one hour walks a day and my sibling and I spend as much time outside with him and play with him as much we can so he doesnt get lonely. He always looks through the windows and glass doors to be let inside but we arent allowed. 

Should I think about rehoming my puppy. Im a minor and I bought him with my own money but I dont have a lot of say on rules in the house. 

He means the world to me and I would do anything for him, and if rehoming him would make him happier then I will. 

Im not sure what to do anymore and I feel like a horrible person for making him sleep outside.

Please can I get your opinions on this situation?

2023-10-16,1697469647,How do I explain ethical breeding to my partner?,"My partner and I are planning on getting another dog in a few years. Were considering a miniature or standard schnauzer (among other breeds).

I was looking at maybe getting a puppy from Canada as the Canadian KC does not require docking or cropping but I havent had much luck. 

My partners parents have gotten their dogs from a breeder who allowed them to pick their puppy, decide if the puppy was cropped/docked it. She thinks that the breeders dont care as long as they get their money. I did say that ethical breeders usually lose money on breeding and they do it because they want to better the breed. And they pick the puppies for the new owners because they have the best idea of which puppy will be the best fit. Im not sure if she entirely believed me lol. We only talked about it last night.

He is my childhood dog and has been with me for 11 years. I remember the day we adopted him from a rescue, just a little puppy. Time has passed by way too quickly and I was not prepared to say goodbye. Parvel has been there with me through everything, he has been my one lantern in the dark. Im still sobbing, It feels so hard and Im not prepared to move on. I miss his barking when I come home, the way he would dig up my sheets when I made my bed. I cry when I see his bed empty, bowls left untouched, his toys left on the floor and his collar in my hand. I call out for him only to remember he isnt going to come. My bed feels empty and cold at night, I miss the forest walks and play. I gave him 11 years of love yet it doesnt feel enough, I feel as if I lost so much. The day before he was put to sleep him and I went on a forest walk, we passed sheep and watched the sunset. 30 minutes before the vet appointment we played with his favourite toy. I held him in my arms as he fell asleep a final time. I wonder if he knew what was coming, if he understood what I was doing? The hardest thing I have ever done was putting down his limp body, remove his collar and kiss his cold nose before closing the door. It feels so real yet unreal, I forgot that he isnt here anymore only to cry 10 minutes later upon remembering. Its like Im expecting him to be there.

She was doing so well and would bark or run to the door whenever she had to go. This was annoying as it was so often, but at least she let me know. Now she only lets me know about 1/2 the time and its me who is trained to ask her.

2023-10-15,1697408261,"Looking for a short term, inexpensive leash situation","I've never owned a dog, but a couple years ago I moved to an area that has a LOT of dogs, including tons of independent breeds that are very good escaping (looking at you, huskies). I go for walks with my spouse on a regular basis, and so far we've found 5-6 dog escapees. I've had to return a very excited husky by holding it by the collar for a 1 mile walk (my back and my hands were very mad about this), and I've also found a couple of rascals not wearing collars at all who I was not able to get a good grab on and as such got away or couldn't be wrangled and lead to a situation where one of us had to follow a dog around while the other looked for an owner and we had to constantly update locations.

I looked in to some leash options and immediately got overwhelmed and feel like I don't have a good grip on what to look for from my lack of experience. Since I'm finding dogs of various sizes, having something that can adjust size but still not hurt the dog would be great. Things I'm looking for:

\-Lightweight and not cumbersome or bulky: I'm primarily going on casual walks and trying to stay light and comfortable. Carrying a bulky leash on every walk 'just in case' just means I'm going to avoid bringing it and won't be ready the next time there's a canine prison break.

\-Somewhat inexpensive: It doesn't have to last a long time or many uses. I just need SOMETHING since this situation has happened often enough that it's probably going to happen again.

\-Is reliable enough not to hurt a dog: I'm an idiot with no experience who is meeting dogs who are either very excited (FREEEEEEEDOM!!!!!) or stressed (THIS IS UNFAMILIAR!!!!). Having something that can be attached to an existing collar but could also be used without one would be great, but I worry about having an adjustable leash that might be too hard to safely use. My biggest worry is a leash that might be too hard to safely adjust, and some dogs are obviously a bit stressed and might panic and struggle post-leash.

If it helps, most of the dogs I've found are medium to large size dogs.

He is 16 pounds and 8 years old, so he is not a new puppy or anything. Hes being transported with a company the shelter uses, and it has really good reviews and is very transparent about how they care for the dogs on the trip, but it is still going to take days to get here. Because of that, I am a little concerned about how to make him most comfortable when he comes home.

My girlfriend is new to owning a dog, but I grew up with dogs and my family was incredibly responsible when it came to their health, training, happiness, etc., so I feel like I have a good idea of how to prepare until he gets here. There are no other pets or kids in my home, and Ill have his food, treats, door bell (to train him to signal when he wants to go out), seatbelt, bed, leash, harness, collar, tooth brush, shampoo, puppy pads for accidents, stairs (for the couch), and soft toys already here for him (his foster said he loves soft toys). I am also working on having his insurance and first vet appointment sorted out before he arrives so he can go his first week. Once we bond a bit and I get an idea of his training, we are going to enroll in classes. We are also dog proofing our home to ensure he doesnt get into anything.

Since he will be traveling for 2-3 days before he gets here, I think he will probably be really anxious and stressed. I want to give him a bath the first day, but I dont want to overwhelm him. He is good with baths (per his foster), so I would hate to do anything that makes him anxious about bathing him. I also am worried about invading his personal space too quickly. He can be a little nervous (his last owner died and the person handling his estate just dumped him somewhere, so the poor boy was living on the streets for a while), so I really want to avoid touching him the first day unless he comes to us first.

Hes always slept with me &amp; my girlfriend, and relaxed on the couch with us.

Just in case anyone is looking for an answer, the answer for us was a ramp! We had a couple steps for them to reach the dog door which is about a foot off the ground.

Problem is, my neighbors dogs male and female pit mixes have turned aggressive. They have always pooped in my yard and barked at us but never like this. Now, they let their dogs bark incessantly at me and my dog when I take her out. Sometimes when their home they calm the dog down. I only saw it twice. Its at the point she cant relax and focus on going to the bathroom. I tried going to the back yard but still she cant focus shes on edge. Looking around for those dogs. They will come in the yard and bark. The male pit mix seems the most aggressive. We can scare him off by walking over to him but he will keep coming back to the yard from different angles. The worst of it, the female pit mix had puppies (we didnt even see them until last week) so, its 5 dogs running around barking and sometimes growling non-stop when we try to use our yard. They look about 10-12 weeks old. They already gave a few away during the week. I know the mama pit wants to protect her babies. Weirdly, this dog was very sweet before. Even a few days ago now she just barks and growls. Maybe could be a going into heat thing? I know during the week they are locked up in the house from about 8-5 ish but not on weekends. Sometimes they only lock up the male. I see their puppies running around and the road I live on is bad for dogs getting hit. I really do not want an aggressive dog. That is the reason I picked out a gentler breed. She sometimes barks one time but most of the time she just stands and stares. She is on a leash at all times outside. Is there any way I can train her to not care about those dogs? Ive been around reactive/aggressive dogs before and heard all it takes is one bad experience. Such as one of the dogs attacking her, and she will associate all dogs with that experience. I want to make potty time more relaxing. She responds well to pets and happy voices, but that only does so much when a dog is growling and barking at her. I couldnt get her to eat a treat in that moment.

How do I tell if my dog is actually hungry vs just begging for more?

Background:
When we adopted our dog was significantly underweight and was being fed 1/4 cup of kibble 2x a day. She is now getting close to the vets ideal weight (12 lbs) so we started cutting her back 2 weeks ago.

Last week we were doing 1/4 c for breakfast and 1/8 c (or 2 tbsp) for dinner. This week we are doing 3 tbsp for breakfast and 2 for dinner. Her weight has stabilized the last 2 weeks around 11.7 lbs. 

Since we started cutting back food we have seen a new behavior from her: every time we go to the kitchen she runs to her food bowl and waits. So we decided to add a Kong mid day filled with frozen yogurt or veggie purée (using baby food that is just veg and water). The first two days it stopped the behavior but it has now returned.

I could not find an answer to this while online and was wondering if this is common or if this boarding place is shady. They only allow pick up or drop off at specific times (9-10 and 4-5) I asked about this and they said I would need to call ahead of time too so ""someone will be there"" now I left my cats there (yes, I know this is a dog forum) so I did not fret too much because cats can handle themselves well alone and I was desperate as I had to leave on short notice for a sick family member. 

Rating online are good. But other family that boarded their pets got pictures of their pets and everything from the boarding company near their cities to show them their dog was safe. So I was not sure if that is more dog specific than cat.

Still...if you have to call ahead so ""someone will be there"" and there are 2 hours total, then does that means they leave all those animals alone 22 hours a day? Because I feel like that is neglect.

Is this normal? Or is it a common policy and they have people there but just do not allow pick up at anytime so they can tend to the animals?

2023-10-15,1697341843,How should I handle people at dog parks who don't recognize that their dog is bothering mine?,"It has happened several times now. Someone who comes to the dog park but doesn't actually pay attention (or simply trained them to ""come"") has a dog that will keep pestering mine (a Border Collie/Black Lab mix), no matter how many times he does a quick bark. If he wasn't so nice, things might escalate.

This most recent time, it was a one-year-old Great Dane that kept following us around the park (which is around half an acre at least).

I don't like confrontation, partly because I have a strong tendency to say the wrong thing. Since I'm a pretty solitary person, this is the only *significant* time he gets to interact with other dogs, and he gets really really excited when he recognizes that we're almost to the parking lot.

I adopted my little girl on April from a refugee. I just can take her out for a walk twice a day (morning and night), but when she sees a dog chasing a ball or an specific little black dog, gets very anxious.

But they loved my application and think I'd make a great dog parent! They asked a few follow up questions to see if they could find me a better fit.

Then another one also already responded. And I don't know why but something in my Spidey senses is tingling. Their application was fairly basic compared to the others. No personal references. Less questions. They already want to set up a meeting. I don't know why that concerns me...it just seems very fast.

Otherwise, they seemed great. They are a 501c3 non profit. They work with trainers and a reputable vet clinic. They say on the website the meeting is with the trainers. They say the dog recently had a dental and is up to date on all vaccines and I'd get a copy of the vet report at adoption. They also have great, all 5 star reviews, from adopters on Facebook.

I did ask some follow up questions about the dog. And I was thinking of asking to see the vet report before adopting. He's 7 years old, but the fact they did a dental is a green flag to me in terms of his health. Since that requires anesthesia. 

So tldr...if the only red flag is they move quickly is that a red flag? I did mention in my application my dog who passed away had subq fluids at home every other day. So I think my application probably had a lot of green flags as a dog owner. Maybe that's why they moved quickly?

2023-10-18,1697670447,Did my mini poodle come from a puppy mill?,"I recently adopted a puppy off craigslist (dumb idea, I know), but the breeder seemed legit. He showed me pictures of the mother and father, both mini poodles, and the puppy was just adorable. I went to meet him at a post office not far from his house about an hour away from where I live. He just didn't seem like a good person, but the puppy was shivering under his arm so I took her home with me.

When I reviewed the medical papers he gave me, they listed the usual vaccines for a new puppy, but the vet's office was linked to Pennsylvania and the breeder's name was blacked out with a sharpie. I texted him about this and he said he crossed out the name for privacy reasons and that the litter was bred and vetted in PA. The problem is he sold the puppy in Yonkers, NY. I asked how he knew the breeder, what his connection was, and he just ignored me.

So, I'm wondering where this puppy could have come from. She's seems like a purebred poodle, going by her body and coat. She's also very clever and empathetic and very friendly and affectionate.

How would I know if she came from a mill? And is there another less sinister explanation for this guy's shady behavior?

Update: Thanks so much to everyone who gave their insight into this situation.  I learned a lot. The puppy is doing well and apparently healthy.

2023-10-18,1697651805,Anxiety/ADHD service dog Training/Eligibility Questions from a newbie.,"Any and all tips are welcome, your time means the world to me and Ginger!  
  
For background: This is my second time training a dog, my first time training a dog that I plan to take with me to school, my next living space, and most places in general. I have time to formerly train her between 30-45 (maybe an hour on weekends) minutes a day, practice her habits (patience, sitting, waiting, staying, etc) the rest of the late afternoon/night we are together, and bring her to various public places for socialization throughout the week.  
She is 8 months (bichon shih-tzu mix) and currently training in basic obedience/socializing/close-following and I will train her to be in public spaces/increasingly distracting environments and buildings etc for every skill everytime we get a foothold on each.  
She is only in the beginner stages and could not start formal (come/stay/stopping and sitting on walks) training until when we got her, but is housebroken and has excellent crate and recall skills (although I think its because we spend so much time together and she loves me so much because she only really comes to ME when called XD, she definitely sees me as home base).  
She has a great temperament overall and is eager to please and food-motivated. The only real challenges I have encountered with her are overcoming her shy (but not fearful-panicky, definitely never aggressive) nature, her tendency to sniff for food at the table (we never give in), short barking/gruffing at bumps in the night (currently in the works of desensitizing her) and obvious puppy energy.  
I am not training her to help me with a physical disability, but my goal is to have her be a solid service-dog-IN-TRAINING for my anxiety/fast heartbeat/adhd as a baseline by these next few (3-5) months, before I plan to move from family and continue college. I initially thought making her an ESA would be suitable enough to just ""tAkE My PReCioUs pUp eVerYwHEre sO sHe ISn't AlONe"" (super dangerous thinking I now know), but realized how much safer and better for both of us it would be if she was trained with the discipline of a real service dog that could actually alleviate daily issues I face.  
And what luck, I think it may be just right for her, since she already alleviates my own fast heartbeat/anxiety/focusing-discossiative issues at home and outside, and is showing a great temperament so far! I just feel like I'm really present when shes with me and she really grounds me.  
Alongside beginner and intermediate training these next few months, how can I incorporate some training on detecting a fast heartbeat and responding by licking? Is there a certian age/stage of training that would best benefit from learning this skill? I think this could be a good fit for her as a real service dog skill since she already licks my arms for a long time very gently when I am anxious on the couch.  
I dont think I could really train her a specific skill to alleviate my adhd symptoms per se, but, knowing how her presence alone already alleviates them, I know that her being further trained to always be focused on me/to be in public spaces as a service dog for my fast heartbeat/anxiety would make it so she could be that grounding presence wherever I go.  
I know training will take months, even years (and it actually never really ends I guess), and am more than willing to do it, she feels like a central part of my life now.  
Overall I want to ensure that the training and skills she obtains are appropriate for a service dog so that I am responsibly/ethically taking her out with me as an actual need, not just as a pet. I would be most afraid of others not taking it seriously or thinking she is unnecessary due to the root issue being anxiety/adhd, not physichal.  
(...WOULD she technically count as a service dog? I just wanna make sure because I wanna be respectful to the community/practice, and so far I feel that my reasons have merit. :I )  
I am sure I could have my psychiatrist evaluate her later on and write a letter once shes fully trained, but would I need some sort of letter to TRAIN her as a service dog when going to public places with her in the meantime? (nothing crazy but like stores, offices, my dog-friendly school)  
I already know that having her with me alleviates my depression, anxiety, ADHD (having her around makes me dissociate less and not get debilitatingly behind on work because it feels like there is someone watching me at all times/someone I am responsible for and having a human around to supervise/care/watch for is just so much more stressful and ineffective).  
Any experienced service dog trainers have a training timeline I could reference or how to teach the licking skill effectively or general advice? any and all tips are welcome!

2023-10-17,1697583040,Is there hope that my dog can be socialized with other dogs?,"Stella is a ~4 y.o. Am Staff who was a stray rescue. She was found very pregnant. For this reason and others (puppies genetically tested 100% am staff) we believe she was very likely abandoned by back yard breeders.

We've had her for ~8 months now. When we first got her she was extremely reactive to squirrels on walks. She would see one and pull wildly on her leash, bay, whine, yelp, etc. She also had a hard time with dogs. She would act very interested in meeting them, but after they got close and sniffed for a moment it seemed like every time both dogs would break out into barking and trying to bite and they had to be physically separated. She's my first dog so I'm sure I probably didn't follow best practices for how to introduce dogs.

8 months later and she's still *interested* in squirrels, but she is very easy to redirect with a terse ""leave it"". She stares at them as we walk by, and she puts her head and ears into a low-to-the-ground ""hunter mode"" but she doesn't lose control like she used to at all.

However, dogs remain a problem. The general pattern of dog encounters goes like this:

- Stella stares at the other dog with her head held high, ears perked up, tail low and still. If I were to try to read her body language and turn it into English I would say it's the equivalent of ""Bring it.""

- The other dog starts barking

- Stella starts barking and whining and pulling on the leash etc. Her bark in these situations is less of a ""bark bark"" and more of a ""bowowowroorroowrororw""

So, like I understand she's probably got a lot of trauma and neglect in her past, *and* she's a breed that can be difficult to socialize with dogs in the first place, but she has also been learning and growing a lot with us.

Is there any hope she can eventually get over her problems with other dogs? I would love to be able to take her places that other dogs might be. If it's likely that she *can* be trained past dog aggression, what are the best strategies here? Any help, input, or further questions greatly appreciated.

2023-10-18,1697589369,"I feel like my Border Collie sleeps a LOT, is this normal?","Hey everyone! I have a rescued border collie who is a little stunted in his growth. A huge sweetheart and clingy boy named Loki, about 3 years old now. He's crate trained and literally can NOT sleep outside of his crate except for naps. 

At night time he will literally beg me to go to sleep, grab my arm, bark at me, whine, the works. This happens until I take him out for his last potty break, then poof, he walks directly into his crate for me to shut.

This is usually between 8pm-10pm. He'll always ask somewhere in that timeframe. 

However, this dude sleeps like a roockkkkk. He wont stir all night, wont even ask to be let out (he'll dead weight me if i try taking him out for a midnight pee). He'll sleep, out cold, well into the morning. Sometimes he wont want to even come out at like noon, or 1pm. I try to always get him up when I get up for work, which is 9am, but sometimes he'll want to stay in there even longer.

So this dog, at best, will sleep soundly from like 9pm-9am and wont want interrupted. At worst, he'll want to just snooze from 9pm until god knows when. 

----------------

Is this okay? He's always been like this, since I rescued him at 2 years old. He eats normally, drinks normally, and the vet says everything seems okay. He gets a moderate amount of exercise from me, admittedly not enough there, but I do take him on extra walks and he goes to daycare for 6+ hours 3 days a week.

So my mom got her own dog a couple months ago. Hes a miniature poodle and hes such a cutie. Hes house/crate trained and does his best to let you know when he needs to go out. The problem is, my dog has recently had a double ear infection so Ive been taking care of that which made my mom more focused on keeping her dog healthy. Im also helping my mom get used to owning a dog again. 

So her dog has not been completely introduced to ear/eye cleaning, teeth brushing, and struggles with baths and nail clipping. Pretty normal but Im helping her with all this since Ive gotten my dog to love bath time and even got her used to weekly eye booger cleaning and daily ear cleaning(still recovering from infection). The problem is she really really does not want to be using treats to constantly reward his good behavior. Which is understandable since hes slightly overweight, and he has back hip/joint problems. But this is the only way Ive been able to train my dog. So is there another way we can enforce the good behavior to make it stick? 

With my dog, I definitely spoil her too much but at this point, only thing she dont like is nail clipping but Im working on that now.

2023-10-18,1697601562,Dog Questionare,"My situation and time has changed from the last time I answered this. As have many of my thoughts so I would like to redo it. 

Notes- 

I live with my fiance and our best friend who will not be moving out for years as we all plan to live together for a while. Our best friend will be referred to as Steph. 

We live in a 2 story town home that is 1,600 square feet and has a small fenced in back yard.   


\*\*Introduction\*\*  
Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\~ÇThis will not be the first dog for anyone in the household. I have owned Schnauzers, Bulldogs, and Cavipoos while my fiance has owned Bulldogs, English Mastiffs, Husky, Black mouth Curs, Pit Bulls, and many other varieties of small breeds. Steph has owned many mixed breeds including pit bulls, labs, terriers, and more.   
  I have experience training a husky, a cavipoo, and a bulldog. Steph has experience training lab mixes, a Husky, and Pitbull Mixes. 

  
2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
\~I would prefer going with a shelter dog. At first I was only wanting a purebred, but after consideration with those who live with me, we have decided that we would prefer finding a puppy at the shelter.  Feel free to recommend mixes you would suggest. 

  
3) Describe your ideal dog.  
\~We do not mind having a high energy dog as we want to go hiking and walking around with the dog. We do prefer a single coated dog as the double coat is something I personally struggle brushing out as it makes me sneeze. We do want a moderately cuddly dog that is decently easy to train. We would prefer a medium to medium large dog and prefer something that will be protective as me and Steph like to walk around at like 2 a.m.. Shedding is not a big deal as we have many tools to keep everything clean. I do not want slobbery dogs and do have cats so prefer something easy to get along with them.   
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\~We are not interested in a specific breed, we are more just looking for any suggestions. I am not very comfortable with a Pit Bull as we are in a area with high dog fighting and we dont want to risk anything happening.   
5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\~We are planning to do basic commands and well as advanced commands and basic service work including opening things by grabbing on dish rags and pulling as well as picking up dropped things and crowd control.   
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\~At the moment we are not looking to compete in sports, however that could change closer to the date we get the dog. 

  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\~I am home all day so it will have a constant companion for playing, but for walking and outdoor training we will have anywhere from 3 to 5 hours a day.   
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
\~We will be able to exercise the dog 3 to 5 hours a day and it will including walking, hiking, or running. We also will take it to the dog park when the park is empty.   
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\~We are open to brushing the dog twice a week. Once every few months we plan to have them go to a professional groomer and we are all happy to trim sanitary areas as well as paw pads and ears.   
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10) What size dog are you looking for?  
\~We would prefer medium to large dogs. we do not want giant or super small.   
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\~Shedding is fine, barking is fine as well, but please as little slobber as possible.   
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\~I am not comfortable letting my dog off leash in an unfenced area, though i would like for that to be something they could be able to learn.   
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\~We would like a mix of both but a bit more snuggles. 

  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\~ We prefer eager-to-please.   
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
\~We would like for the dog to bark to alert us of someone knocking on our door or entering out yard, but we would like for them to be friendly to strangers and visitors if we introduce them.   
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\~No we are not, that is a big reason why we want a puppy.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\~We dont want a got that will go after the cats.   
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\~ The dog will be left alone very rarely. When it is left alone it would only be for 3 to 4 hours at a time once or twice a week at most.   
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  
\~ Everyone in the house is on the same wave length about the dog and we will all be trading off and on what to do. 

  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
\~ We have 3 cats, all are indoor only. We do not plan to get any more animals after the dog for the foreseeable future.   
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\~ The dog will not be reacting with children very often at all.   
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\~We rent our townhome and there are no restrictions. 

  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\~ USA - not aware of any bans  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\~ Summer is 90+F can get up to the mid 100's. Winters average at 60's through 40's but can go colder. The seasons are very sporadic here.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
\~ I put all additional information up top. 

  
26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

\~I do not currently have any questions. ",dogs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ahlfw/dog_questionare/

How do I make this stop?,"It isn't every time, but maybe every fourth(ish) walk he suddenly twists his head around, snags his leash in his mouth and will either keep walking while whipping his head around with it or will stop walking and try to jump on me with the thing in his mouth and just generally acting up. He's a mouthy dog and tries to nip my sleeves while I untangle the leash/attempt to sort him out. I'm tired of tripping over him and have a bruise on my arm from his antics today.

He's a 9ish month old lab mix. If it matters, we walk with a soft harness where the leash attaches to the back. The leash is not even in his peripheral sight as we walk unless he glances back at me, which he sometimes does - with absolutely zero interest in the leash. Other than this issue and some basic manners we're working on, he walks on a leash just fine and he has zero issue with the harness.

2023-10-18,1697630538,Best way to teach puppy to ask to go outside?,"Hi everyone! 

My question is pretty much the title. We have a new puppy who is almost 12 weeks old, and we have been doing pretty well with taking him outside frequently so he is peeing and pooping outside 95% of the time. However, we have found a few pee puddles and one poo pile in the house in various places. These have all been found within 45-60 minutes of previous trips outside, and we have yet to hear or see any ""asking"" behavior. Our previous pup (9 years ago!) was taught to ask by the other 2 adult dogs we had at the time. This time around we are sadly without other dogs, as they both passed. The adults taught the pup to scratch at the door, which worked for us since the sound carried no matter where we were in the house. So does anyone have ideas how to teach the pup to scratch the door or something similar so we know to let him out an extra time?

Some extra info: we cannot use a doggy door because we also have 2 cats in the house and 6 hens in the back yard whom we do not want to be trading places. The back yard is fenced, so we do not see any problems there, although we have been going out with him to make sure he at least pees. He takes a while to sniff around and find a poo spot, but once in a while he gives up sniffing and just lays down to play in the grass. 

Puppy picture will be in the comments (if I can figure out how to do it - still learning all the functions).

Ill put her on the leash and walk her 100m (about 100 yards I believe) away and as soon as I let her off she bolts back there and starts the crying/barking/trying to climb process again. The park I usually go to is huge but because of this tree obsession, we cant even go to half of it because she will be there all day looking at imaginary squirrels and completely ignore anyone around her. Its so bizarre, and so unlike her usual character. Any tips? Cant avoid trees& theyre kind of everywhere",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17ape8z/my_dog_is_obsessed_with_trees/
2023-10-18,1697631918,Never realized just how much my dog trusts me,"I took my poodle girl to the vet. She gets really scared going there because in the past, she had a traumatic experience having to be brought in half paralyzed and in tons of pain. I also think having to stay at the hospital for a week really scared her. She is doing much better now though and relearned to walk! So this time was just an annual check up.

Still, she was shaking during the exam. So I stood with her and took her head in my hands so she could try and focus on me instead of all the poking and prodding. Oh my gosh, the look in her eyes was of complete trust that I have never felt from anyone else before. It was like she was trusting me with her life!! She was such a good girl for the dr after that - staying very still as much as she could. 

I love her so much and I feel so honored that she loves me so much too that she would trust me with everything like that. I know how precious that is and promised to protect her forever.

2023-10-18,1697614017,New border collie parent,"Hi everyone, 

I have recently adopted a very young border collie puppy who has been abandoned. Honestly I had no intention of getting a dog as I suddenly lost my gorgeous soulmate pup at just 15 months old only in June. It tore me apart beyond any pain Ive experienced (and Ive experienced quite a lot of very personal loss). I am still in therapy and on anti depressants. That is not the purpose of the post apologies, just wanted to stress that this new arrival was very much unplanned.

My other dog was a Weimaraner so Im no stranger to high energy and extremely intelligent dogs but would love to hear from other border collie owners about the breed.

Shes extremely intelligent and within about 2 days was toilet trained. We got her a few weeks ago and she only turned 12 weeks yesterday (she was abandoned so unfortunately didnt get sufficient time with her mother).


We do training a few times a day for 10-15 minutes. 
Recall is so hard. We work on it and she 100% gets what shes meant to do but couldnt care less when theres a distraction = shes only a baby though so we will keep working on it. 
Frozen Kong in the crate 
Weve ordered agility equipment to do some agility training with her. Shes not overly enthused yet but shes so young so we know it will take time. 
Shes SO vocal omg. My weim was not a big chatter she talks back about everything. Its not really a problem tbh shes not excessively barking but just barks a lot more then my weim.
How do I know if shes bored or over stimulated? My husband says Im over doing things with her and shes not getting enough rest but I get worried shes bored and unhappy. Is there signs of over stimulation to look out for? My weim was a huge couch potato. Once he got his 2 walks a day and a bit of play time he wanted to spend the rest of it chilling. He didnt need anything like lick mats or kongs, but with her she has no off button. She will absolutely not rest no matter how tired she seems unless shes locked in her crate. I would love to be able to cuddle with her on the couch in the evenings after a long day but she just tries to chew me or the pillows etc. I redirect and she is clever and knows but she still doesnt want to chill = is that just a puppy thing or what are my chances of having a cuddle with her in the evening? 

We absolutely love her. Shes so funny and sweet, very sensitive and needs lots of reassurance which I am happy to give. 

Any other general tips or tricks for this particular breed? We dont have a farm so she wont be herding but I plan on doing agility, hiking and hopefully running with her (Im a runner and doing my first marathon so when shes older Id love to take her on runs with me).",dogs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17aku6u/new_border_collie_parent/

2023-10-17,1697585953,Compassion Fatigue,"I'm dealing with compassion fatigue pretty roughly right now. I work with many dogs for a living, and I also have 2 dogs. Dog training is also my hobby. And then I spend a lot of mental effort on trying to change people's minds about aversive methods, give advice online, etc. When I'm not doing all of that, I'm reading dog training/behavior books and listening to r+ related audiobooks in the car. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until typing all this out that I realized how overboard it sounds. But, everything except the training method debates brought me joy, not stress. Knowledge helps me feel less overwhelmed so I won't stop reading. Though now I'm listening to an audiobook about compassion fatigue. I have stopped talking about training with people, I have stopped giving advice, and have slowed down a ton on training one of my dogs to the point where she has regressed a little bit in her frustrated reactivity. A family member is dog-sitting the other for a few weeks. At work I feel irritable and lack empathy most days, but some days I get a flare of motivation to bond with the dogs I work with rather than just do the bare minimum work.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else work with dogs for a living (veterinarian, shelter worker, rescue work, etc) but also has made dog training and care their hobby as well? How do you balance it? I can't seem to get away from dog-related stuff, and any breaks I take from them aren't enough because if I'm not fully distracted by something else, my mind goes into problem-solving mode and I'm either trying to come up with ways to do my job better, debate with aversive trainers better, or care for my dogs better. I recently started therapy, though just one appointment so far and the next one in a week and a half, then hopefully weekly after that.

I'm a new dog owner and my puppy got to 85 pounds and isn't able to comfortably sit in the car seat.  
My car has bucket / captain seats at the 2nd row and 3rd row is just smaller regular seats. [Here is an example](https://di-uploads-pod6.dealerinspire.com/mariettatoyota/uploads/2020/04/2020-Toyota-Highlander-Interior-2.50.41-PM.jpg).

I'm having issues finding a solution that will fit my car and be comfortable for a larger dog. As of right now, I put one of the captain seats down and I have someone sitting in the seat beside him to make sure he stays down. It's not really ideal because his feet fall into the gaps where he can easily break something AND, I need to constantly have a second person with me to take my dog to the dog park or anywhere else for that matter.  


Is there some sort of bed or cover that has a middle portion to go into the space between the seats? Wondering if someone came up with a decent solution as I wasn't able to find much online.

2023-10-17,1697575425,Advice on dog breeds?,"I previously made a post with  the questionnaire but not I did this right as Ive not gotten any responses. Ive included it below. Thanks in advanced. 

 **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 
* Originally we wanted a cavapoo, I know someone who has one and hes the cutest thing, great with their kids and I live that he doesnt shed. But after reading some posts on here were now thinking it might not be such a good idea to get a designer dog. Other breeds were interested in are mini poodle, frenchie, beagle, bichon frisé
or a miniature schnauzer.

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 
* We just want a family pet that will grow with our (future) kid and likes to cuddle some, maybe a dog we can take on trips etc. nothing crazy and no hiking etc.

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?**
* The only experience I have was living with my sibling and taking care of their puppy while they recovered from surgery. He is a Golden retriever/Siberian Husky mix. I took him to Petco training classes but my sibling never continued past the first level and the dog has some behavioral issues because of this( I believe). He is a big floofy cuddle bear though who loves kids and I do miss that.  My partner did have a family dog( pomapoo) that they trained in HS but the dog had a lot of behavioral issues and was very anxious, they had to re-home the dog at 8 years old because it was stressful on the dog and everyone in the house.

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?**
* No other pets, possibly considering a cat in the future but I have allergies so probably wont happen. 

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 
* Dont have kids yet but going to start trying next year, we have friends with kids but they live far so dont really visit. 

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?**
* Currently rent and saving to buy but we live in a townhouse and a very pet friendly city. 

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?**
* Me and my partner, we both love dogs and would be sharing responsibilities.

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**
* Rarely

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 
* Were not opposed to rescuing but a little concerned that rescue could be unpredictable due to past trauma etc. this is especially a concern since were planning on having a baby in the next year or two.

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 
* We would prefer a puppy that can grow with our family.

**What size dog are you looking for?**
* Small-medium, not a teacup or tiny dog. 

**How much barking is too much barking?** 
* Would prefer not much barking but barking when someone knocks or warning us is fine. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**
* Hoping minimal, a couple times a week would be fine. 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?**
* Prefer minimal to no shedding.

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 
* Yes and whatever we cant do we will take them to a groomer.

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 
* A normal amount of farting is fine lol but I cant handle slobber(sensory thing). 

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 
* Would love a dog that likes to cuddle and wants to make us happy, possibly sleep in bed with us  but also can be independent. Dont really want a dog that will have separation anxiety etc. 

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 
* Basic commands, nothing special.

**Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?** 
* Aggression, especially towards children and small animals.

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 
* Not that important but would be nice if they could be off leash sometimes. Not a deal breaker though. 

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 
* During the week we could do 1-2 hours, we work very close to home and my partner can also come home during their break to take them out. Weekends we can do longer as we live in a walkable dog friendly town and have a lot of parks nearby. We also open to indoor exercise suggestions. 

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 
*An hour or hour and a half. 

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 
* We plan on crate training and have a living room we could close off and make safe for when were at work etc. 

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 
* 4-8 hours during the week while were at work but my partner can come home during their break so they wont be continuous. 

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 
* My partner would come home during their lunch break and we could hire a walker if needed but prefer not to have to.

**What is the general location in which you live?**
* We are in the Tri-state area. 

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?**
* 80°-85° Fahrenheit in the summer and 30s in the winter. We dont plan on moving from this state and even if we did it would be to a place with a similar climate.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**
* 10, weve put off getting a dog for a while and we now feel like we have the time and stability to make the commitment.

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 
* Yes, from dealing with my siblings dog I know about insurance etc. and we also have money in savings for any emergencies.",dogs,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17a86u3/advice_on_dog_breeds/

Our nine year old Siberian Husky was diagnosed with diabetes last week and last night we picked up his insulin and what not, and met with the vet to go over whats expected of us next. He is supposed to be given two doses of insulin daily, after breakfast and after dinner. Our issue.. he rarely ever eats breakfast. He and his sister (Golden Retriever) usually get their food dropped n the morning between 8am and 9am but sometimes they wont eat until hours later (especially if its a day they go to doggy daycare, twice a week), theyll sometimes come home at 3:30-4pm and eat their breakfast as lunch instead, then dinner at 7-8pm. I know we could stop dropping their food and leaving it by pulling it up when we leave the house, but I feel like that wont cause our husky to eat his breakfast so we can give him his morning insulin.

Dinner time is less of an issue, as he usually eats dinner pretty regularly, just trying to figure out the morning situation. Were considering buying some food toppers, or even giving him chicken on top but doing that every morning may get a bit much and I feel like hell start ignoring even that soon.

Anyone ever experience this and have any tips/suggestions? Right now the one-a-day insulin wasnt an option presented to us, and when we brought this issue to the vet we basically got an answer of you have to make him eat breakfast.

2023-10-17,1697516738,Guilt about decision to euthanize,"This weekend, my 6 year old beagle suffered one of the most unexplainable accidents I've ever seen. I was out of town on business. All info I share was while I was on phone nearly the whole time. 

My wife let our dogs outside as normal in evening before dinner time. After about 30 minutes our beagle did not return. She used collar tracker and saw his location in woods center of our property. All our dogs are in this area frequently during the day. She went to retrieve him believing he found another rabbit hole. She found him laying on his side impaled with a sumac branch. The branch entered underneath his front leg and exited behind his rear leg. There was very little blood. She called my sons outside. They immediately brought car to his side and transported him nearly hour away to emergency vet clinic. 

Every effort was made to stabilize without removing stick or having dog make any sudden movements. During the ride, he developed slow labored breathing. Very little blood leaked from either wound. He remained awake the entire ride. Upon presentation, the clinic sedated and intubated him. Xrays were taken. 

Vet came out and explained the stick penetrated his diaphragm. He had a pneumothorax. And was in state of shock. Was explained would need to transport him to surgical vet center 30 minutes further. Would require MRI to determine other organ damage (if any), significant surgery with no assurances of survival. Followed by 4 to 7 days hospital stay. All this we could expect upwards $8000 to $10,000 minimum. The vet said she would completely understand if we decided to euthanize... Which was the choice ultimately made.

Now comes the extreme feeling of guilt. We didn't ask further questions. We didn't ask for details on specific needs. We didn't even make attempt to try. I'm now feeling we didn't give our 6 year old a chance at a long life. I continue to question if we made the right decision. We had the money in savings. But it's a complete feeling of selfishness that we didn't try.

I blame no one. This was a freak accident. Why do I feel so much shame? I can't change the outcome so reliving and asking if this-if that is futile.

The hard part is coping with memories. I can only relive when we punished him. I try to remember the good and loving moments but my brain goes straight to the bad. 

Did we do the right thing? How do I get over this overwhelming feeling of betrayal and guilt to a dog that trusted us. We've lost many dogs over the years.

2023-10-17,1697503625,Any thoughts on 2 different doggy daycare with very different environments?,"Hello all,

Coming to the trustworthy experts of reddit on an important topic for our 2 yr old cavapoo Truffle! We are considering 2 different daycare option for Truffle, and wanted your thoughts and input on which one you'd choose for your pup.

[**Daycare A**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dog-retreat-and-spa-waltham): Truffle has been going here for daycare / boarding for the last couple years, but increasingly he doesn't seem so happy and seem a bit stressed (hence we're looking for another option).

\- Daycare A is run like a well oiled machine at an industrial scale - 100+ dogs / day with a large warehouse indoor / outdoor space, dogs separated by size. Nice staff, truffle is excited to see most of their staff.

\-They let dogs roam free in their indoor / outdoor section all day long. From pictures and descriptions, Truffle is almost always just laying down and not doing much.

\-However, we know that there's constant, loud barking from large dogs all day long and their indoor space while separated into sections, it's essentially one large room with several dozens of dogs.

\-Truffle picked up barking from here, and also many days after coming home he's quite reactive vs. if he spent the day at home or went on a group walk he's not reactive.

[**Daycare B**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/skipton-kennel-waltham): New place we're curious to explore

\-Similarly highly rated on Yelp

\-Much smaller daycare with at most 40 dogs

\-however, their system is different in that they keep most dogs in indoor crates while a small group of max 4 dogs that are well-matched are taken to the outdoor space at a time. Owner says each dogs typically go outside 4-6 times a day. Seems the dogs are better able to 

\---

While the crating for several hours gives us a pause, having spent a lot of time with Truffle, I know he doesn't necessaryily move around a whole lot either and I wonder if he'd be able to better enjoy the playtime and more attention from staff members at Daycare B in a quieter environment.

Which daycare do you think is better? Which one would you send your puppy to?

Thanks!!

2023-10-17,1697503135,Just adopted a dog and I probably shouldn't have.,"Hi everyone,  
  
I made a big decision about a day ago and adopted a 4-year-old pitbull from an animal shelter. I was looking for a buddy to help me through some tough times, and I'd heard that dogs are great for this, so I eagerly went for it.  
  
However, I've realized that I may have been too hasty and not understanding my dog's wants and needs. I haven't been the best trainer, and today, I made a terrible mistake by putting him in a cage he spent countless months in. I wasn't aware of his emotional needs, and he ended up biting me. Thankfully, I'm not physically hurt, but it was a wake-up call that I've been approaching things all wrong. I expected him to be perfect when he's just being a dog.  
  
I've thought about giving up on this dog, but I really don't want to. I want to make things work. My biggest question is, ""Can I win my dog over?"" Can I make him trust and respect me? I'm willing to do whatever it takes and be there for him, but I'm afraid I may never be given a chance.  
  
Right now, he went for an extremely long walk and slept for a few hours, but he doesn't seem interested in me at all. I would greatly appreciate any help or advice you can offer.

My boy is working on becoming comfortable being around other dogs after a dog owner lost control of a ""its okay, he's friendly"" dog who bit my boy transferring a virus that caused my dog to spend 4 days in the ICU recovering from the incident. The owner of the other dog? Fled the scene never to be seen again, never facing consequences for his neglect as my dog is fighting for his life and we both are traumatized. 

That was over a year ago and I am still working on being comfortable because no matter where I go to work on it we always at some point another ""its okay, he's friendly"" dog that sets our progress back. Today, there was a dog in the back of the park that I could not tell if it was on a long line or not but my gut was telling me to give even more space than normal which resulted in me opting to use nearby patches of trees to hide us from view as we skirted the park to re-enter the complex that I live in. Unfortunately for us there was a very poorly timed dog walker that entered the situation drawing the dog out into the middle, resulting in several minutes of audible conflict that had the new position of the dog able to see us. I tried to get somewhere that we were once again protected but I accidentally attracted the dog's attention who started to harass us. At one point the dog came in close enough that in the split second I could not tell if he had actually bitten or not, but I had also reacted to kick at the dog as my vocal attempts to deter the dog was not working. Of course the out of control dog owner started to cuss me out for kicking at his dog, but the second dog owner backed me up before the out of control dog's owner fled the scene again leaving us to deal with the consequences of his actions.

I am tired of doing everything in my power to avoid a situation and still resulting the victim of someone else's negligence.  I am tired of fighting the tightness in my chest everytime I think I see an off leash or even recently a leashed dog. We have leash laws, I should feel safe walking my dog without going to extremes like hiding in the wooded areas to avoid being attacked. I know I am unlikely to reach the people who engage in this behavior on this sub, and that the problem individuals will not see their behavior as a problem even after reading a vent like mine.

We both live in gated houses but not enough outdoor space for our dogs to run around so we let them out on shared neighborhood space in front of our houses at least thrice a day. We were used to each other's schedules and since all their dogs are very reactive both to humans and animals, we try not to let our dog out at the same time they do, opting an hour or two after them. We tend to adjust to them and follow their schedule since they're a couple in early 60s or late 50s (we're in our mid-20s). This works for both of us for the most part.

The problem is, earlier today, my dog is running around the neighborhood and due to his excitement of being let out way earlier than usual (and thus having more time to play outside), he doesn't want to go home just yet, and instead of going inside on his own or letting me carry him home as he always does, he made me chase after him instead. While running around, he passed by the neighbor's house several times, aggravating their dogs. They keep them outside the house but inside the gate. Neighbor was very irritated and went outside to shoo my dog away and told me ""If you can't control him, put him on a leash. My dogs are very noisy because of your dog."" And now they wanted to ban my dog from going near their house, which we can't avoid since our house is beside theirs and we needed to pass by to go somewhere else.

I understood neighbor's sentiments, but I feel like my dog is not in the wrong since he's very smart, well-trained and he didn't do anything aside from running around the neighborhood and not wanting to go home. But at the same time, we know their dogs are reactive, so maybe it's our fault? We appreciate any advice or constructive criticism. Thank you in advance.

Additional info: Both neighbor and us keep our dogs off leash when going outside. We can't go to other places because our dog is scared of cars, and we need to pass the road to go outside of the street (also we have no car).

Neighbor has a small dog with a really loud bark. She has been really nice about trying to help reduce this noise, which I've appreciated. She mentioned a few things about this dog:

- it came from an animal shelter and I think she only trusts her and barks a lot at anything else.

- occasionally the barking is an issue for her inside her own home because the dog wakes her up, and she isn't sure how to fix the situation.

I had wanted to gift her a good book about dogs that might be helpful. I saw there was a book by a lady named ""Turid Rugaas"" that was all about barking (I think it's called ""Bark""), but I didn't want to give that book, because I don't want the gift to seem like I'm just trying to solve my own problem. In fact, she's been really helpful already, and I wanted to give a book just as a gift that might be useful and interesting to her to show my appreciation (of course it would be cool if it helps the barking situation for me as well, but that is not the primary reason)

2023-10-22,1697993517,Enrichment Ideas please.,"Hi I need some enrichment ideas. We have a 10 year old female rescued mixed breed. She was originally a street dog from Romania but she has been with for over 9 years. Just over 2 weeks ago we lost her brother. We are all devastated and grieving terribly. Ebony is a very easy going girl and I won't lie, because her brother (a border collie) had a strong personality and very clear exercise and attention needs. I think I concentrated on meeting his needs and Ebony just came along for the ride. Now hes gone and I want to make the rest of her life as amazing as possible. Now to the problem, I don't have many ideas what to do. Ebony is 10ish, she is 10kg/22lbs, she is diabetic so meals have to be strict, with no treats or meals in-between. Ebony doesn't enjoy toys. She does like her cat laser which we play with. She has at least 2.5hrs of exercise a day. At least 1hr is off lead. I try to go to different places. Her on lead street walks I let her choose the route we take and she can stop and sniff as much as she wants, as I believe it her time. She already knows quite a few tricks/commands. I try to take her into dog friendly shop eg pet shops, garden centres etc as she enjoys them but obviously we can't do that everyday. I worried she's lonely and unhappy. She seems happy but like I say she's a relaxed kinda dog. She just mainly sleeps when we are home.

2023-10-22,1697973058,Breed recommendations please!,"***Introduction***  
  
1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I currently own a 2.5 year old Poodle mix. He was an owner rehome who I got about 1.5 years ago - trained him through some pretty severe separation anxiety (which was very much a struggle at the time but glad we've made it out the other end)!   
  
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? 

Preferring to go through a reputable breeder. Would actually prefer an adult dog who has a known temperament (I hear those puppy blues are a b\*tch!).   
  
3. Describe your ideal dog.

Prefer a small-medium breed dog (probably max out around the 15kg mark). I currently own a dog and an 8 year old cat who play together all the time, so an adaptable dog with low prey drive! Low shedding and low barking as my cat sheds enough for the lot of us and I will potentially be living in an apartment! A dog who is happy to go-go-go when we are out on the weekends, but happy to be a couch potato during the work day. No separation anxiety (worked my way through that once with my current dog and it's not something I'm keen on doing again!). I'd also love a dog who loves swimming/water!   
  
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\- Goldens (Pros: generally friendly breed, recommended for beginners, has an off switch. Cons: larger size and concerned about weight restrictions in apartments) 

\- NSDTR (Pros: pocket rocket, drive to go. Cons: can be an anxious/nervous breed, higher energy, Toller scream lol) 

\- Standard poodles (Pros: very smart breed, has an off switch, very low shedding. Cons: similar to goldens - concerns about weight restrictions in apartments)

\- Whippet (Pros: beautiful apartment dogs, off switch, pretty happy-go-lucky, couch potato after sufficient exercise. Cons: concerned about generally anxious nature of whippets, prey drive with my current cat)

\- Cocker spaniels (Pros: good size, trainable, OK energy requirements Cons: EAR INFECTIONS CENTRAL!!!!!)   
  
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Nothing too extreme, would just be the general basic obedience (sit, stay, place, off switch, recall etc.).   
  
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

Potentially considering agility or scentwork as I think my dog at the moment would also enjoy, but not a necessity/guarantee!   
  
***Care Commitments***  
  
7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

Obviously understanding that a puppy requires high attention, however, following probably about a year-old, would want to integrate the dog into my current dogs routine. Training-wise I usually do at least a 15-20 minute training session with my dog a day. Playing is ad hoc as my dog requests. I work from home and will be continuing to do so (at least while I am in my current job and I see no plans to change anytime soon!) so interaction is also plentiful throughout the day!  
  
8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

As above, hoping to integrate with my dog's current routine, which is usually 3-4x walks during the work week (about 45 mins each) and one long outing on the weekends (varies from dog beach, 4-5km hikes etc.). I do take my current dog to the dog park, but this is sparingly and only once I've driven past and see that there are no dogs there.   
  
9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

Very happy to do regular grooming. My current dog is a Poodle mix and I've learnt to do all of his grooming at home and have all of the equipment (fortnightly bath, full groom every 6 weeks, nails done weekly).   
  
***Personal Preferences***  
  
10. What size dog are you looking for? 

Small to medium size (max around 15kg) - based on general apartment size restrictions I've seen).   
  
11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

Low to medium shedding, minimal barking and minimal slobber.   
  
12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Very! A lot of the parks I go to with my dog now are off-leash and unfenced.   
  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
  
13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

Open to either, my current dog is a snuggler so not too fussed if my next dog is one that prefers their own space.   
  
14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please? 

Generally biddable.   
  
15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

Prefer more on the aloof side!   
  
16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

No - currently have a dog and a cat already, and not something I'm willing to manage.   
  
17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid? 

Definitely separation anxiety! My current dog also has a plethora of general health issues (pretty sure he was byb) so would like a generally hardy dog (for reference, my dog has a sensitive stomach (lots of bouts of inappetence, diarrhoea etc.), recurring ear infections, anal gland issues - he's been to the vet more times in the 1.5 years I've had him than some dogs go in a lifetime!).   
  
***Lifestyle***  
  
18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

Working from home so not often during the work week, but would like them to be able to manage being left up to 5/6 hours on the weekends when necessary.   
  
19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

N/A - live alone.   
  
20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

Yes - 1 dog (poodle mix, 2.5 years, 7kg) and 1 cat (chonky stray cat, 8 years old, 6kg).   
  
21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

Not at the moment, but likely as friends are starting to talk about having children.   
  
22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No - own my house now and looking to buy an apartment in the near future. I believe the standard breed restrictions for Australia apply (pit/bullies, Japanese tosas, Dogo Argentino etc.) and most apartments also have weight restrictions (most are under 10kg, I've seen a couple with 15kg).   
  
23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Australia - breed restrictions include American pitbulls or pit bull terriers, Japanese tosas, Dogo Argentinio, Fila Brasiliero etc.   
  
24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

Average day in the summer is probably around 25 degrees Celsius, winter average gets to about 10 degrees Celsius. It can also hit temperatures above 40 degrees in summer so definitely want a dog that can tolerate heat!   
  
***Additional Information and Questions***  
  
25. Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I'm not looking to get a dog until likely 3-4 years time, so hoping for some recommendations so I can get on some good breeders waitlists for now!   
  
26. Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-10-22,1697983206,Help with a nervous pug! Thank you!!!,"Sorry If my questions are dumb! 

So my Pug, Pugzie, got attacked for the ninth time by the same neighbors dog! two year of intense training, hard work, and socialization. She now seems like a nervous wreck!

I am here because I wanted to ask if she is reactive, nervous, or neither! I also wanted to ask if i should hire a professional trainer! I will describe her symptoms here:

First off when she sees a dog she will stare at them! sometimes she will bark, and sometimes she won't! its for sure she will stare at them, and has a hard time breaking that focus! I have been training her not to bark a dogs so maybe thats why she stopped, but she will slip some barks! Most of the time when she stares she will lift a paw! not sure if that means anything with her body language!

When we are walking and a dog barks at her, sometimes she will walk past fine, only if i guide her with a treat tho. Other times, she will start barking, and fixating on them, while she raises all her hackles! When this happens i have no choice but to step on the side. When she hears a dog bark she will most likely bark too!

When she hears a dog bark anywhere, she will go off! its the worst in the house. Her hackles will raise and she will be very stiff and alert. Normally she will make a bug alert bark, and then continue her bark storm! 

The worst of it I will explain here. The dog who bites Pugzie is our neighbors dog. Their dog also bites Pugzie through the fence (we do not let Pugzie there anymore), and has a HUGE fence fighting issue. Before all of this Pugzie was fine with dogs, and never had a reaction in the backyard. Now when i let Pugzie out, she will instantly charge around the backyard with her hackles raised, pacing back and forth barking at the neighbors side. If she hears the neighbors dogs collar jingle she will have a huge reaction, and it gets worse when she hears the dog bark!

But if the dog barks when Pugzie is outside this is when she gets her worst. She will SPRINT to the neighbors fence and start having a horrible fence fighting reaction! no stopping her. Treats, loud noise, removing her, nothing. She would be unable to settle after, and her body language would be very alert.

Out on a walk Pugzie doesn't step near the neighbors house! she is terrified of that area! 

Sorry for such a long read! if you made it here i really thank you for putting up with me! im really confused! Is she reactive? I would say she is but sometimes she doesn't bark, and can walk past dogs just fine! she will be staring, but no reaction!

Thank you so much guys!!! I appreciate you!!! ",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17dtx6s/help_with_a_nervous_pug_thank_you/

We love the idea of getting a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, but are a apprehensive of the health concerns. We have found some breeders who do the OFA certification, but none that do the MRI testing for cm/sm. What other breeds should we consider?


1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

We both had dogs growing up, and adopted an older dog from a shelter before we had kids. He was great, but bit me pretty good on a couple of occasions so we are not wanting to go that route again with our young kids.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

See above.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Small, loves kids, loves people and dogs (we live in a busy area with tons of people walking, events, etc.). Not too high energy.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
CKCS because of their friendliness and energy level. Maybe Havanese but worried about leaving it during the work day and barking.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just general manners.

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

No preference

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Smaller in size. We have a 4ft fence

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Barking is the only thing that we care about avoiding.


12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Hopefully no/minimal barking and a friendly greeting

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I can't think of any

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

We are teachers, so 8 hours during the school year (can do a dog walk/dog daycare a few times a week if needed). We will be home quite a bit during summer and holiday breaks.

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My wife and I will share the responsibilities, and the kids will just have a buddy (hopefully!).

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No other pets

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, our 2.5 and 4.5 year old kids. Other kids in neighborhood on walks.

2023-10-21,1697912988,what breed is our little pup?,"Hi, everyone! We just adopted our little girl and shes been listed as just about every breed.

As a backstory, she was rescued by a shelter from a puppy mill situation in Ohio (what we were told with not a ton of additional information), adopted out to a family, surrendered when she was just about a year old by her previous family, and had been back at the same shelter for the last 3-4 months when we got her.

She was most recently listed as a beagle/miniature poodle, but her previous vet records show lab and golden retriever, as well >7<û@

To me, she looks like a dachshund mix of some kind because of her size and shape. However, her ears definitely look like a beagle. I had a dachshund/chihuahua mix years ago, and she reminds me of him.

She also reminds me of my old flat-coat retriever in terms of her coat texture and length.

Of course, it doesnt matter to us, whatever she is, just thought itd be fun to see what some other people thought. 

If its of any help, when she was 14 weeks old her weight is listed at 6 pounds and when she was a just shy of 1 year it was listed at 14 pounds. Took her to the vet yesterday and she was 19.8 pounds. Shes about a year and a half so, from my understanding, shes full grown.

Personality wise, shes EXTREMELY mellow. Chews on her toys a little, can run pretty fast if shes excited and doesnt seem to have much interest one way or another in other dogs. 

Thoughts? Anyone have a similar looking pup?

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Nope, we have had a few dogs in the past, e.g. spaniel and golden retriever.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Don't mind either.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

On the smaller side, quite biddable so my dad can train it. Affectionate but not scared to be independent. Would have to be good with kids as we have a 10 year old  in the house. Would prefer a dog with less drive because we are also looking into getting a cat. No shedding and not much barking.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Mostly toy breeds like poodles, chis etc. I have a soft spot for terriers and hounds esp borzoi, italian greyhounds, westies but knowing we might also have a cat at some point, might not be a good idea.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Recall if possible, sit, stay, roll over, paw etc. Maybe some more difficult things in the future.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

 Not really.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

A few hours

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Would never take my dog to a dog park. Willing to do an hour or two of exercise depending on the day.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Don't mind at all, but don't want it to be high maintenance. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium/Small 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

As little shedding and barking as possible but absolutely no slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Never unleashed unless properly recall trained, doesn't include in the house and garden.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A little bit of both.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Again, a little bit of both. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

We don't get many visitors but as little barking as possible would be nice.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Possibly.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Not really.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

If alone, probably 2-3 hours but that's not everyday, there will mostly be someone at home so separation anxiety isn't a major problem.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Dad wants a larger biddable dog, mom wants a smaller non shedding affectionate dog (Unfortunately not possible), and for me the same as my mom. Everyone will take care of the dog.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

May look into getting a cat soon enough.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, a 10 year old, but they understand boundaries.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

None.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in the UK, not sure about breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer, around 18-22°c, winter 6-13°c

2023-10-21,1697908582,How to introduce your dog to the pool,"Hey guys, a few months ago my family adopted a Border Collie which has now turned 8 months old.

She spends most of her time in the back yard, where we have a large swimming pool.
All this time, the pool wasnt an issue of interest for her. She didnt drink from it, didnt even attempt to get in.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing, as her lack of interest in the pool is one less thing to worry about it also leaves us worried whenever she's left alone in the house. Whenever that time comes, we either leave her inside or lock her in one of the sides of the house (outside). She doesnt like neither of this options and it breaks our heart to see her bored when we return, we know she'd be much better off just staying in the yard, but we are afraid she may accidentally fall in the pool.

Summer is coming to where I live, and it would be a great time to teach her. She's already seen a few people jump into the water, but she still doesnt approach. My pool is deep, with a very shallow end (I think its called a solarium) where she could reach if she was to fall or even jump and easily get out.

I need to teach her to get into the water and swim to that part but I dont want to just pick her up and get her inside. 

How do you do this?

TLDR: I need to teach my dog to get in the pool and swim to a shallow end so we can leave her alone in the yard.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17d7gyy/how_to_introduce_your_dog_to_the_pool/

No  
*Care Commitments*  
**7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

**8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
Open, anywhere from 1 to 3 hours during the week, longer on the weekends. We walk pretty much everywhere and would plan to bring the dog along.

More on the eager to please side of temperament.   
**15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
We don't want a guard dog or anything like that, we would prefer a dog that is reasonably friendly to strangers or visitors, but not so friendly that it would want to leave with them if they offer it a treat.   
**16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
No  
**17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**

2023-10-21,1697880944,What Dog Breed Should I Get?,"Introduction

I am a parent in a family of 5 living in a medium sized house with a small backyard and a large oval literally across the road.  
  
1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes, this will be my first dog that I have had since my childhood.  
  
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I do not have a preference, but I would rather get a purebred dog as I will better be able to research what the look and behavior of my dog will be.  
  
3. Describe your ideal dog.

My ideal dog would be one that is reasonably quiet, not hyperactive, and will be loyal and obedient to me and my family. Ideally, it would have a multifaceted personality, which may include stubbornness (like myself).  
  
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I am open to any dog breed, but I think that Japanese dog breeds (especially Japanese Akitas) and the Australian Cattle Dog have incredible looks, but I am also interested in Basenjis as they do not make loud, sudden barks, which 2 of my kids dislike.  
  
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Fairly simple instructions at first, such as stay, sit, quiet. It would be great if I could also train it to do other things as well.  
  
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I am not interested in doing any of these.  
  
Care Commitments  
  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Since all of my family will look after the dog (but mostly me), it would probably be several hours per day.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

A maximum of 1-1 1/2 hours, mostly walking and possibly going to a local dog park.  
  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I would prefer not to pay a professional, but I would be willing to groom my dog a few times a week.  
  
Personal Preferences  
  
10) What size dog are you looking for?

Any size between 8 and 40 kilograms.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

A relatively small amount of barking, ideally not to much slobber, but as for shedding I do not mind the amount.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

It would be nice, but certainly not one of my top priorities.   
  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Ideally a balance, but leaning towards personal space.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Again, ideally a balance, but leaning towards more independent.  
  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would prefer it not to bark or jump up at visitors but be a little more reserved.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes, I would be willing to manage this.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

No, but ideally a more quiet and independent 'cat-like' dog.  
  
Lifestyle  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

My husband and I usually work from home all day, but ideally it would not bother us too much when we are at work.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

As for my children, I will make sure that they will have a role in walking and feeding the dog, and they do not have any particular preferences but would it would be easier for them to get used to a quieter and more independent dog at first.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No, we do not have any pets so far and are not planning on getting any (other than the dog).

  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

2023-10-21,1697858269,Enrichment for a sedentary chihuahua,"Is there any way to engage a young but sedentary dog and provide him more enrichment?

Background: I have a 6 year old male chihuahua that I adopted when he was about 1.5 years old. The adoption center said they found him wandering the streets so there's not much information about his medical history or background. They did mention that he might have been abused or was never properly socialized based on his behavior around people. So it was hard to engage him in play or socialization in the beginning. We didn't want to overwhelm him so we let him call the shots and approach us at his own pace.

He's come a long way since then--he absolutely trusts us and is overall a pretty happy pup. When we first brought him home, he'd lie in a corner of the room we cleared out for him and wouldn't approach us at all. Now he regularly demands scritches and affection.

He's pretty sedentary though, and try as we might, we were never able to pique his interest in balls or toys. We actually got him squeaky toys when we first got him, but the squeaking actually scared him and he ran off to hide under my bed. :(

He spends most if his days sleeping and naps next to me when I come home from work. I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do to engage him more, or if some dogs are just satisfied with napping next to their humans.

He gets two walks a day in the morning and the evening, each about 30-90 minutes long. He's allowed to sniff and play with his doggy friends if we run into them along the way. On days where we have extra time, he's allowed to choose the route and explore the neighborhood. We are wary about dog parks, but we take him out to a local mall and to Petco every weekend so he can pick out his treats or just sniff to his heart's desire.

Other than that, he gets a couple of hours each morning or early afternoon in our backyard because he loves to sunbathe. My mother (his grandma) is constantly with him so he's never alone for more than an hour or two. 

I hang out with him after work, and I've tried to engage him in toys or teach him tricks. We hide his treats under towels and blankets so that he can sniff them out on his own. But other than that, he seems to be more interested in snoozing next to me.

Is this normal or should I work harder to enrich his life in any way? If some dogs are satisfied with snoozing, that's fine. But I don't want to cheat him of any experiences that he could be enjoying. He seems comfortable, but I can't tell if we are doing what's best for him

2023-10-20,1697840442,Dog running away and misbehaving,"My dog is an 8 yr old lab who has been with us his whole life. He is neutered and was trained as a puppy. We live on an acreage and for years his job was to roam free on our property (generally within sight of the house) and scare off predators of our chickens with his presence. Lately he will not stay home and for the last year or so we have not been able to leave the house unless he is locked up in the garage or he will run away. 
Now he is running away anytime he is outside. He will go as far as 2.5 miles away and neighbors are constantly calling and bringing him home. This is happening when he is out for 5 minutes to use the bathroom and people are home or when we are working outside and he is supposed to be with us. 
Even when he is inside he is doing something naughty like getting on tables and counters to eat human food, opening doors, making a mess of cat litter, getting into the pantry and eating whole packages of food ( wrapper included). This happens when someone is in the bathroom for a few minutes or taking the other dog outside. He just cannot handle being left alone. 
We have tried shock collar training, underground fencing, and walking boundaries and none of it has worked for longer than a few weeks. 

I know he is bored and lonely because my parents work more and my siblings and I have moved out but today I took him out to play fetch with him and when I stopped to pet the cat for a minute he ran away again and the neighbor brought him back.

Im currently contemplating adopting a 10-week-old Caucasian Shepard and Australian Shepard mix and Id genuinely appreciate your input. Heres a picture of the little guy (hes about 3-4 months old, weighing somewhere between 25-30 pounds).

https://ibb.co/RSwzZGk
https://ibb.co/b1F2KSQ

Ive done my homework on Caucasian Shepards and know they can be quite protective and not always welcoming to strangers. My home frequently has visitors, so a dogs behavior towards newcomers is a significant consideration. Given this mix, Im curious about your thoughts on whether the Aussie genes might temper some of the typical Caucasian Shepard traits, making this pupper a good fit for my household.

Im committed to proper training and socialization, but I still have concerns about how the dog will behave with the frequent guests we have. I be read a lot of about Caucasian shepherds and have determined that it would irresponsible for my family to have a full bred - as we always have constant home visitors and other dogs around, and the caution around strangers many owners say is impossible to train out of the breed. Have any of you had experience with this particular breed mix or insights on how it might work in a house that often welcomes new faces?

Thanks in advance for your insights and advice!

2023-10-20,1697822834,Help me find my perfect breed!,"What kind of dogs should I get?

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will not be my first dog. I currently have 2 dachshund mixes and have raised and trained a lab puppy for a service dog organization in the past.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I am looking exclusively for a puppy, but am open to either. I only hesitate with a rescue/shelter dog because despite getting my current dog at a young age (under a year), there was already a lot of fear aggression imprinted on him. It has taken him many years of hard work to get him to the point where he is, and he still hates almost everyone new he encounters. I'd like a puppy I can train and socialize and mold from the very earliest stages of its life.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

I would love a dog to go for runs and hikes with me. The dog would be easily trainable, and I am willing to put in the work (see above experience being a volunteer trainer for service dog org). I would prefer a dog who likes to cuddle, but is also independent when necessary. 

My top breed requirement is low or no shedding. I've been spoiled with low and no shedders in the past, I don't want to have to lower my standards of cleaning just because my dog sheds.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

After having two dachshund mixes (one being mixed with terrier) and living next door to a black and tan hound, I am definitely leaning towards Team Terrier. I love their fierce and fearless attitude, their energy levels, and most of all I love that they are low shedders, haha.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Ideally I'd love to have them pass the CGC and see what kinds of doors that opens for us. I'd also love to train the dog to ignore distractions so we can run without stopping for a sniff at every tree.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work from home and can devote as much time as necessary. I have experience being a volunteer trainer for a service dog organization, which entailed many hours of at-home training and training in public settings. I'm very ok with high training needs.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I am willing to put in as much time as my dog's energy demands. I'd like a running and hiking partner, but I also have many dog puzzle toys for rainy days. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Grooming needs are not a concern. I'm happy to do it at home or take them to get professionally trimmed.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Small to medium.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Minimal to no shedding. Barking is tolerable. Slobber, no thanks.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I have a large fenced in backyard.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'd prefer a little of both.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager-to-please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I would work on socializing the dog for friendly greetings. An initial alarm bark is ok, but just as a notification, not as a deterrent to the guest as in ""stay off my property.""

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. I am dealing with that right now with one of my current dogs, and I'd like to be a puppy raiser for the service dog org again in the future, so the new dog needs to love other dogs.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

None other than listed above.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Minimally. No more than 6-8hrs twice a month if we have a busy weekend. Otherwise, we both work from home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My partner and I agree on all of the above. We are a child-free household.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Yes - possible service dog puppy would be a lab or golden lab.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We are in and own our forever home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in the USA in TN. I'm not aware of any breed bans.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers get significantly warm - highs in the 90s + humidity. Winters are mild - lows in the 20s overnight. Snows less than 5 times/year.

2023-10-20,1697792535,First time dog owner: specific breeds in question,"Hi guys!  
  
Me and my partner are looking for a dog. We have specific breeds in our minds but I thought I double check if it's the right decision by your advices!  
  
***Introduction***  
  
**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
\- This will be our first dog but we always had dogs around by growing up. My family has a good friend, she has an American Akita and I always have the chance when they are around to walk him. Also my bf's sibling has a golden retriever.  
  
**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**  
\- Reputable breeder. For like a good year or two I've been searching for the ""best"" by breed.  
  
**3) Describe your ideal dog.**  
\- Smart; cuddly; easy to train; lower health risks; medium or+ size. I would say active because we are too, but not like a Belgian Malinois level. However I really really love that breed, they are amazing (but I'm not that masochist:))  
  
**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
\- Dobermann - My childhood dream dog I really love them as is: I don't even care about the looks, I'm fine with no crop, whatever. I just love their personality. BUT I'm terribly afraid of their health problems, such as DCM, wobbler, cancer etc. Im in a Dobie group (from my country) and it's absolutely heartbreaking to see them die around 4 years old... I don't know if I should get a Dobie or not, even in the future.. not because of the money..  
  
\- Pembroke Corgi - My boyfriend's pick. They are THE dog for him. He likes their look, their funny personality and the fact that they are in a healthier edge. We know that they can be stubborn but he said he prefers that personality trait instead of the velcro type dogs, because we really like if the dog is a cuddly bubble, but it's preferred if sometimes they are independent too.  
  
\- These two dogs are our most preferred breeds but we also like: Labradors, Aussies, GSD.

*At the moment we lean towards Corgis.*  
  
**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
\-Basic &amp; advanced tricks, crate training is a must. Btw It really depends on the breed, follow-up in the next question:  
  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
\-If we would get a Dobie or a GSD, I would do obedience training. I don't have experience but I would love to get.  
  
***Care Commitments***  
  
**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
\- 2+ hours a day. Probably more than this, as both my boyfriend and I work from home. Sometimes I have to go to the office but if I'm away, he will be at home.  
  
**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
\- I don't really like dog parks I heard a lot of horror story. I would do what they need but I would prefer around 2 hours. + mental stimulation, puzzle games etc. I was a runner in the past but due to a health disease I stopped but I'm feeling better and would love to start is again so running is also included besides regular hiking.  
  
**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
\- Absolutely. Don't know why but I find brushing a relaxing activity lol. ""how much"" is depends on the dog's needs but I'm up to it.  
  
***Personal Preferences***  
  
**10) What size dog are you looking for?**  
\- Medium (Corgi) Medium+ (GSD, Dobermann, Aussie, Lab etc)  
\- We don't prefer to get breeds like poodles, miniature pinschers, spaniels, chihuahuas etc..   
  
**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?** 

\- I don't mind shedding and barking but no slobber please.  
  
**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**   
\- Not at all.  
  
***Dog Personality and Behavior***  
  
**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
\- An equal amount of both is fine with us: I would love for my dog to snuggle on the couch with me, but also ok if it wants it's own space.  
  
**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**   
\- 50-50! not sure  
  
**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**   
\- I don't mind if he is protective and barks but I would like my dog to be friendly with people he already know &amp; likes. Obviously this comes with training, but I would like it's temperament to be friendly.  
  
**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
\- If it happens, I HAVE to manage it. But I prefer a dog that can coexist peacefully with other dogs.  
  
**17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
\- Reactivity  
  
***Lifestyle***  
  
**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
\- Someone will always be at home but if we have to leave for more than 4+ hours, a family member would be there because we live close by.  
  
**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
\- Yes as I mentioned my bf really like dogs and he wants it with me. He would take care of the dog and would love the activities together but I think I will be the main caretaker!  
  
**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**  
\- No  
  
**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
\- No, not planning it anytime soon. We are 26.  
  
**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
\- No. We have an aparment + my bf's dad's house is 5 minutes walk away with a huge garden.  
  
**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
\- Hungary and yes.  
  
**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
\- Summer 28 - 32 °C, Winter 9 - -5 °C  
  
***Additional Information and Questions***  
  
**25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**  
\- I've been waiting for this moment since I was 5! I am researching morning to night, checking a lot of informative videos about traning, habits etc, looking up for food, making a little checklist.. I am a planner type so this has been my last year about. I'm beyond excited.",dogs,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17c6r0t/first_time_dog_owner_specific_breeds_in_question/

2023-10-20,1697768954,Are my dogs at risk of littermate syndrome?,"Hi guys,  


About 3 weeks ago I decided to Foster a dog. Where I live currently there are a lot of dogs at the shelter and there's not many people adopting. Due to the increasing summer heat airlines are no longer flying dogs from my location to major cities in order to be adopted. As a result many dogs/puppies are being euthanised if they cannot find a foster home.  


The dog I fostered 3 weeks ago is very sweet and well behaved. They believe she is around 4 months old (can never really tell exact age with strays).  


I was contacted by the agency about another puppy that they desperately needed to home who is 5 months old. I agreed to foster this puppy too but was unaware of littermate syndrome.  


It's been less than 24 hours since I've picked up the second puppy but could I please get advice on how best to avoid littermate syndrome or if this will even be an issue? The dogs are vastly different breeds and the 4 month old is definitely human bonded.  


Any advice is appreciated! ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17c0kqz/are_my_dogs_at_risk_of_littermate_syndrome/

I used to go running with her all the time because we'd both be able to exercise. Now, I've graduated &amp; I live in the city.  I can't have dogs in my own apartment, but my building does allow dogs. I want to get back into exercising but it doesn't really feel right without her. Also, because of the area I live in, I'd feel more comfortable with a dog just for my safety. 

Would it be right to put up a flyer or ask around if anyone needed their dog walked or if they needed the exercise? I'd literally do it for free as long as the dog was well tempered and I wouldn't mind reinforcing training &amp; stuff too because I trained my dog for several years. I just want to get back into exercising and I love being around dogs. I don't know if that's weird though and I looked into Rover &amp; it was a lot more than what I really wanted. I'd have enough time to do just one dog in the afternoon for like an hour and a half and bring them back, but I could do it on a daily basis if the weather permitted.

2023-10-20,1697765043,Dog refuses to let us put ear cleaner in,"Our dog is around 9 years old. His ears are often inflamed and irritated. We brought him to the vet awhile ago and they told us to put Probiotic ear cleaner in his ears to clear them up. The thing his he hates when we put anything on him (wont take baths, wont let us clip his nails, etc.). Ive heard people say you just have to do it quickly but I would rather not get my arm bitten off? He isnt an aggressive dog or anything and is somewhat well trained but just WILL NOT let us do things like that. His ears are always so red and itchy and I know we could make it better for him IF HE WOULD JUST LET US hahaha. 

Even though he is trained he was a rescue dog and we dont know what hes been through and his behaviour is a bit unpredictable. I genuinely believe he would bite someone who tried to put ear drops in. I see him snarl (showing his teeth) and snap at us when we go near him with that stuff.

Anyone else faced a similar problem? We gave up on clipping his nails (we use nail files for those really long ones) and bathe him with lots of warm wet towels, but it seems like there is no alternative to putting the cleaner in his ears.",dogs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17bza23/dog_refuses_to_let_us_put_ear_cleaner_in/
2023-10-20,1697765049,How to stop a 1yo corgi from chewing up the carpet.,"Im at my wits end. My corgi is a year and three months old. Shes normally so sweet and well behaved, but shes gotten into this habit of chewing holes in my carpeting when Im not looking. 

It first occurred earlier this year in March. I had stepped into my bedroom to fold laundry (with the door open) for maybe 15 minutes while she was asleep on her dog bed out in the living room. I come out from my room to a small hole she had torn into my carpet near her dog bed. I immediately gently shooed her away and offered a nylabone which she took. She has a mountain of nylabones, and various antlers and bully sticks. Shes never so much as chewed a shoe ever since I brought her home at 8 weeks. The only damage shes done has been to my carpeting. 

I covered the hole with a rug until I could have someone out to patch the carpet and the spot has been covered with the rug since I had it repaired. 

Cut to three days ago. 

I live in a small, two bedroom apartment riddled with extremely worn carpet. The carpeting was old and patched all over when I moved in 5 years ago and its only gotten thinner since Ive moved here. Dogs have only been living here for the last two of those years. 

I was showering for maybe 20 minutes. When I came out she had chewed a massive hole through an old patch near my roommates bedroom door. All the way through the pad to the sub flooring. I caught her at it as I was coming out of the bathroom, and again I called her in to the living room and offered her something from her toy basket. 

Today I had a carpet repair person out and she patched the carpet for me. Maybe two hours later I was in the kitchen cooking dinner, and my roommate came in to the kitchen to ask me if the carpet specialist had already fixed the carpet. I told him yes and his face fell. Sure enough, while I was cooking, she had started pulling up the newly patched area.

The carpet muncher in questions name is Kiwi. I take Kiwi on walks three times a day, speed walking, for 2 miles round trip, and hard tug-of-war sessions for 30 minutes or so, at a time, whenever she brings me her rope. We go to the off-leash dog park 3 times a week for 2 to 3 hours at a time where shes constantly running between rounds of fetch and her need to greet every person and dog at the park on any given day. 

She is a noise anxious dog. Fireworks and sudden loud noises make her fearful, hard to recall, and if were at home she hides in her crate. 

My dad recommends that I obtain a newspaper or magazine, and I told him to sit and spin. I have only ever used positive reinforcement with my animals, but he said clearly its not working. Completely calling in to question my training methods despite my older dog Ripley being an absolute angel.

I need recommendations, insights, deterrents, anything. I have already asked my landlord if I can pull up the carpet and replace with vinyl flooring to match the kitchen, and that was a hard no.

I was reading about sprays with bitter agents in them. Do these actually work?

Will a 6-foot chain link fence cut it or do I have to go the Vinyl or wood route? From your experience, what do you suggest? I can go the more expensive route, but I would like a cheaper option if it will be just as effective because I have a crappy neighbor.

2023-10-20,1697762986,Is it normal for dog to go absolutely nuts on walks??,"My dog is 4 years old unneutered male pitbull/lab/dachshund mix. Overall, hes a generally chill dog, hes not hyperactive in the house at all. Sleeps a lot, doesnt chew on anything or destroy anything, really chill in the house. But whenever we go on walks he does a completely 180 and just goes nuts, I tried tons of leash training but he still basically drags me, hes like so excited I cant even get voice commands through to him, even before I get the leash on hes going nuts and panting and whining like crazy. He lunges at other dogs. I leave my house at 7:15 for work and come back at 5:30. He doesnt eat all day unless Im there with him, even though I leave food out for him. So I figure its best to feed him as soon as I get home. So he eats around 5:30-6 , I wait two hours until walking him so we walk around 7:30-8 and then yeah he goes nuts and nothing works he doesnt care about toys or treats or praise when hes in that state. Is it because he has to wait all day for a walk? Should I switch to walking him before I feed him, like right after work? What should I do?

EDIT/UPDATE:

just a quick edit because I dont think I explained our daily routine that well. Hes not inside until 7:30PM, thats just when we go out for our hour walk. I live in a house with a pretty spacious yard with trees and an abundance of sticks so as soon as I get home(5PM) I take him outside, he goes to the bathroom and we play. I chase him around, we play fetch, he does his business. We do that for about half an hour. Then he likes to people watch too so sometimes we sit in the front yard. I sit in the chair and he roams around the front yard then usually sits or lays down to watch the cars go by and the people ( I dont live on a busy street like he speed limit is 30km/h but theres many kids and pedestrians and parked cars people usually go 20km/hr plus he knows not to run on the street or off our front yard ) for another 15-30 minutes. Then I bring him inside to eat anywhere around 5;30-6PM. I leave food out for him while Im at work and he doesnt eat it but he will as soon as I am home. Then I wait two hours to walk him but in between that time we are outside in the back or the front people watching atleast two to three times. I smoke cigarettes so we go outside frequently. Then at 7:30/8PM we go for our hour walk. Then he goes nuts. I have him go from the front to the back off leash and hes fine, chill, listens. Just when I put the leash on and take him for walks he goes nuts. BUT!!! Today instead of waiting, I took him for a walk immediately after getting home from work. Usually by the time we walk its dark and I feel bad he doesnt get walked and enjoy the sun. But today we walked as soon as I got home from work and during the day so he got to enjoy somee sun light and it made a HUGE difference!! I cant believe i didnt try this before I just thought for some reason he shouldnt walk on an empty stomach. I mean its still not perfect he still excited and pulls a bit but not nearly as much and hes not nearly as crazy when trying to put the leash on and he didnt lunge at the dogs we walked by. Our routine will now be switched to walk first and then eating. Next week I will try to get him to the off leash dog park after work before it gets dark and see how that goes! Thanks for the advice but rehoming and neutering arent an option. I did also forget to mention Ive been looking into switching jobs for awhile and I am looking for remote jobs or hybrid where I can work from home so he doesnt have to be alone. This isnt the end all for my dog, I was going to school and two jobs for awhile  to get us a house with a backyard and I did that, I am 24 and got him when I was 20 and put in the work to move us from our apartment to a house with a backyard and I did that. now that im there I want to spend as much time with him as possible and my life revolves around him soo Ive been job searching for work from home jobs so dont just think me and my dogs lives are stagnant, I am always working on bettering them and spending as much time as I can. I just took off 6 months to spend with my dog and am back working again taking back my old job for the income but I am searching for work from home jobs so dont worry. Thank you for the advice and Id you have any more please keep them coming. He also goes to doggy day care once a week because I found a place that would take an unneutered pitbull after searching and searching and I found one and he goes once a week. I. Will be looming into either a dog walker or taking him to the day care more. I dont believe in neutering unless I had a female dog who could easily get pregnant but I dont, or if I had a dog who was sexually active but Jerry doesnt hump.",dogs,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17byl2s/is_it_normal_for_dog_to_go_absolutely_nuts_on/

Hello Fellow Dog-Lovers!

Im a first time dog owner (Bernese; 9 Weeks) with my boyfriend and we are trying to read up as much as possible about dog ownership, care, and training. 

We just got him this week and for the last four days, we have been trying our best to train him in potty training, using the leash, and not biting us or anything important (like our wires). Hes doing so well when it comes to using the leash (hes a farm dog) and will get there eventually with the biting, but I really worry about how were doing on potty training. 

He has been able to successfully use the pee pads about 80% of the time since we started using his own urine to add a scent to the pee pads instead of just giving him a clean one. This has helped tremendously in him going to the pee pads. 

Right now, about 25-30 min after each meal (he eats about 4 times a day between 8am-6pm at the moment), we also take him out for a walk where he does his duties. So thats about 4-5 times a day he goes out to pee/poo because we also go once before bed.  The pee pads are more there for when we cant anticipate he needs to go outside. 

My question is, are we doing this right? Am I teaching him to hold his bladder at all by taking him out so much or giving him pee pads or should I not even expect it at his age?",dogs,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17brbxc/am_i_doing_potty_training_right/
2023-10-19,1697752224,Match my mom with a breed,"

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
- this will not be my first dog, ive owned well over 50 at this point, lots of experience with rescues and well bred ethically bred dogs. My main expereince is with mozambican mutts and mastiffs like boerboels

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder
- i am looking for a well bred ethically bred purebred 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.
- as this will be a co owning situation with my mother and i, im looking for a dog who is calm enough to live in a city apartment and go about day to day life with an hour and a half of enrichment and exercise being enough to fufil him and every weekend we do obedience. On the flip side they need to have high endurance as my mom will be taking him on frequent hikes that are very long like the alps or trecking through the litoral of portugal and through spain. It should be an adaptable dog. No barking at people on the roads, neutral to dogs or friendly, wont go insane in a car. 

The dog shouldnt shed much if at all, preferably wirehaired or haired.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
Im interested in any gundogs (spaniels, water retreivers, pointers, some herding breeds like the portuguese sheep dog)

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Nothing in particular, just a companion

**Care Commitments**

For a month its very chilled, hour and a half of excercise, building muscle, puzzles, snifaries, fetch and play/obedience, swimming most days and then more 1-2 months he is out hiking for days at a time

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Bellow 50 cm

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Little to no sheddinh

A snuggly dog would be nice

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Shouldnt have any issues with visitors though some skepticism is not an issue

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No dog aggression, however terrier type sparring is okay as long as its manageable and  nit insane like an american staffy. They need to live with other dogs

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

No

At the longest 7 hours but it wint be frequent

Pretty involved as its a co ownership but its everything ive desibed above

2 cats and one dog aswell as another possibly coming next year

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

My first thought was this was a scam because usually breeders price them higher.  I reached out asking if they were still available but didnt follow up.  Then I got a text saying they had been reduced to $250.  I asked how old they were and he said they were 12 weeks which seemed to partially explain the lower price.  I asked for pictures of the mom and dad too and they had some right away so I figured it was probably legit, and I took a friend with me and decided to visit them. 

When I got there, there were six little puppies in a fairly small fenced in area in the driveway to the point where it seemed almost more like a cage than a fence.  It made my heart want to break.  It was strange because it only looked like three puppies in the add.  The puppies were adorable but very shy for the most part.  The man showed me records of their vaccinations, and after spending some time with them, I told him I wasnt quite ready to bring one of them home, but could come back in a couple of days.

I wish I had asked more questions about how he ended up with the litter, if it was intentional or not, since clearly this was not an ideal way to be caring for puppies.  But the man was big and a bit gruff, and I was too afraid to ask more questions.  

Now Im facing this moral dilemma: on the one hand, it breaks my heart to think of those puppies staying there any longer and Id love to be able to help just one of them out of that situation.  But I also dont want to support unethical breeding practices (although given the vaccinations and about a month of food, it seems like $250 might just be an attempt to break even).

Lets say in this hypothetical, the dam and sire are both health tested and have all the other signs of being ethically bred

Also, out of curiosity, what breeds do you think should have the standard changed for the benefit of the dogs?",dogs,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17g1bnd/in_your_opinion_can_breeding_to_standard_always/
2023-10-25,1698233633,Can you recommend a doggie breed to us?=,"Hey everyone!   
Me and my husband are looking into getting a dog next year, and we are now researching what breed might be the best suited for us. Both of us had doggies in the past, so we have some experience already, but it would be still great to hear some advice.   
Thank you in advance! :)

**\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\***   
  
\* Small breeds - we live in a small apartment!   
  
**\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\***   
  
\* Doggie will be our family member, that is how we see it. We will do our best to always include our pup in all of our activities. We like cuddles and lap-sitting pups hehe.  
  
**\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?**  
  
\* I owned a Bolognese, my husband owned two Chihuahuas in the past (one was a retired show doggie). We were both the primary caregivers. We are now mainly looking at some other breeds.  
  
**\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?**   
  
\* Nope, no other pets.  
  
**\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\***   
  
\* We don't have children yet, and don't get many visits at all (basically none lol), but we do plan on having a child in the next couple of years.  
  
**\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?**  
  
\* We own an apartment in a high-rise. Don't plan on moving anytime soon.   
  
**\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?**  
  
\* So far just me and my hubbie. In the future, possibly a kid.   
  
**\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\***  
  
\* Like twice a year haha. My mum occasionally comes over for a coffee, perhaps once a month.

  
**\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\***   
  
\* Not really, although in this area rescue puppies are quite difficult to come by (that is a good thing I think?) so we might have to go the breeder route.  
  
**\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\***   
  
\* We would like a puppy.  
  
**\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)**  
  
\* Small breeds only (up to 40 cm?)   
  
**\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\***   
  
\* All dogs bark and we are aware of it, however, we will definitely strive to train our pup not to bark excessively. Occasional bark when playing or excited etc. is okay of course, but prolonged one not that much.  
  
**\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\***  
  
\* I am happy to brush daily if needed :)   
  
**\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.**  
  
\* Little to no shedding would be the best as I am a bit prone to allergies.  
  
**\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\***   
  
\* Yes absolutely, happy to.  
  
**\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\***   
  
\* Slobber is not so much my thing heh.  
  
**\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\***   
  
\* As long as it's a happy pup and somewhat trainable for non-professionals, it's okay!  
  
**\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\***   
  
\* Basic commands are a must! We don't plan on any competitions etc, but definitely want to train our doggie to be well behaved and (at least usually hehe) obedient pup.  
  
**\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\***   
  
\* A lot of barking/howling - we do live in apartment with neighbours. However I know that this could be mainly diminished with some training.  
  
**\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\***   
  
\* It would be nice, but it is not super important to us as none of our previous doggies went off the leash mostly for their own safety.  
  
**\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\***   
  
\* Definitely walks at least 3 times a day, preferably one longer one daily. On weekends and days off, long walks.  
  
**\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\***   
  
\* Since I'll be around the apartment pretty much all the time, I am happy to dedicate most of my free time to the doggo.  
  
**\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\***   
  
\* Sleep anywhere it wants to, we will of course provide a doggie bed. When alone, we will leave the biggest room + hallway always open so there is space, comfort, but also not so many objects that could be a potential threat to a small breed, or objects that could be destroyed hehe.  
  
**\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\***   
  
\* Very rarely, although we'd like it to be able to handle some alone time fine. We both work from home, so are present nearly all the time. Occasionally, we go out to places not really suited for doggies, but aren't away for longer than 3.5 hours max (once a week, sometimes twice a week).  
  
**\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\***   
  
\* Yes, but not needed as we both work from home and my work is very flexible when it comes to occasional walks throughout the day.  
  
**\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).**  
  
\* Czechia  
  
**\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?\*\* Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.**  
  
\* Summer can get hot up to 33°C, Winters can get cold down to - 15°C.  
  
**\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\***  
  
\* 100! To us, doggie is a family member.   
  
**\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\***   
  
\* Yes!Aware of all these things.",dogs,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17g2nqr/can_you_recommend_a_doggie_breed_to_us/

2023-10-25,1698196806,Do you ever kick your human out of your bed in the middle of the night?,"My human sleeps on my bed in the bedroom of my house.

More recently, she's been staring at the big light box on the table and going to bed really late.  I'm actually a considerate doggo because I wait for my human to get on my bed first, and then at exactly 4 am in the morning, I will jump in the bed with her and sleep.

Since she's staying up later, I don't think she's using her bed anymore so I've been getting in it and sleeping there starting at around 9 pm.  Since I sleep horizontally on the bed rather than vertically, she's been moving me JUST so she can also fit in the bed-- the audacity.  

I'll be honest.... There really isn't room for the two of us.  I was so generous in sharing before.  So when she tries to move me around, I just burrow under her head and kick her off the pillow so that she doesn't have anywhere to sleep on my bed anymore.  But sadly, I don't think she's getting the message because she still tries to move me so she can keep sleeping on my bed.

Does anyone else kick their human out of the bed or room?  Does anyone have any ideas of how to tell your human that you're done sharing your bed with her and that she should go sleep on one of the smaller beds on the ground that she keeps buying?

2023-10-25,1698198044,Looking for a lower energy trainable dog,"Breed Questionnaire

 **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?** 

* I am open to any dog breeds that fit my criteria. Some breeds that Im particularly interested in are Great Danes since my family had one when I was a kid and pointers mainly the English ones since Ive heard German Shorthaired pointers are more hyper. I am very open to other breed suggestions though. 

**What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?** 

* I want a dog for companionship and obedience training. I want to train him so he can earn his Akc good Citizen and I also enjoy trick training as well. I want to take my dog lots of places like the beach and on vacations (I already know lots of dog friendly places from my last dog) so I want a dog who isnt too protective or anxious since they wouldnt do well with my lifestyle. 

**What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** 

* I owned a golden retriever as a teenager and currently live with another golden who I babysit for often. I have also owned a German shepherd who passed away a few years ago. I clicker trained both my dogs and my gsd earned his Akc good citizen. Both of my dogs were raised by me from puppyhood. 

**Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** 

* I live with a neutered male golden retriever and a neutered cat. 

**Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?** 

* I do not have children nor do I have any that visit me. 

**Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** 

* I own my house. 

**Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?

* I live with my sister but I will be responsible for my dog. My sister is completely on board with me getting a dog as long as it gets along with her golden. 

**How often do you have visitors to your home?**

* I have visitors about once a week. 

**Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?** 

* I will only go through a reputable breeder. 

**Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?** 

* I will be getting a puppy. 

**What size dog are you looking for?** 

* I like medium to giant sized dogs. I do not want a small breed since Im used to large dogs and prefer them. 

**How much barking is too much barking?** 

* My German shepherd was extremely vocal but I would prefer a quieter dog that barks mainly to alert. 

**How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**

* I am fine with regular brushing. 

**How much shedding do you think you can handle?** 

* I live with a golden that sheds like crazy so thats not a problem at all. 

**Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?** 

* I will trim my dogs nails and clean their ears weekly like I did with my other dogs. I also can brush or do deshedding if necessary to the dogs coat. However, I do not want a dog that needs to be trimmed/shaved regularly. Poodle type hair is a no for me. 

**How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?** 

* Neither bother me. 

**How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?** 

* I want a trainable dog. I can deal with mild stubbornness but being able to follow commands and respond to positive reinforcement is very important to me. I also prefer Velcro dogs over independent dogs. 

**What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?** 

* Skilled obedience and also trick training which will just be for fun. I will be entering him in training classes with a trainer I trust. 

**Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?** 

* Aggression of any kind especially same-sex dog aggression. 

**How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?** 

* Its mildly important. I do not want a dog that is a runner or escape artist but I very rarely have my dog off leash and when I do its only when they have reliable recall and lots of practice heeling in controlled settings. 

**How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?** 

* I would prefer a low to medium energy dog. I do go hiking sometimes but on average I would prefer a dog that can be satisfied by going on daily walks and playing with me in my yard rather than going on long runs. My German shepherd was very high energy and I do not want a dog that energetic. 

**How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?** 

* I have a lot of time since I work from home. 

**Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?** 

* The dog will sleep in bed with me which is why I would prefer a cuddly dog. When I am gone, the dog will be crated until he can reliably be left alone to free roam. 

**How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?** 

* I work from home so not often. He will only be left alone when I run errands or go out with friends. If I am gone longer than 4 hours, I will have someone babysit him. 

**If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?** 

* Yes, to everything except doggy daycare since I do not trust doggy daycares because a friend of mines dog got attacked by another dog at one. 

**What is the general location in which you live?** Y

* I live in the US 

**What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** 

* I live somewhere thats sunny and cool to warm most of the time. It doesnt snow or get really cold here but it can get hot in the summer. 

**On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?**

* 10

**Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?** 

* Yes, I am aware and prepared.",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fth9d/looking_for_a_lower_energy_trainable_dog/

I still take him for walks but lots of the time hes confused and just stares into the distance.. these walks are not long. Maybe about 6 to 7 mins.. 

Really I do it for him to get some fresh air and walk around.. He wears a diaper all day and usually poops in the house.. We cant really get into a groove with him anymore.. Hell go right before a walk or even right after.. doesnt matter if I change the times..

I got him when he was already about 7yo the doc didnt know for sure.. he has some pretty bad dental hygiene and I got his teeth cleaned but it already turned into his bone disease where his bottom jaw is sort of soft tissue at the front of his mouth.. he doesnt cry or complain if I touch it.. hes really only awake to eat.. of which he loves.. but he literally eats everything or tries to.. like tissue paper, plastic straw.. his poop other dogs poop.. just put random things in his mouth like a baby and I have to watch him like a hawk..

He eats human grade turkey and chicken that I boil and feed him with premium dog mix.. its been good for him.. I think its why hes lived so long& Im just at a loss now.. idk if Im just prolonging his heartbeat or actually giving him a good quality of life.. he doesnt play with the other pets.. barely knows theyre there.. doesnt come when hes called .. he just knows sound ques like clapping hands or the bowls in the kitchen meaning food time.. 

Outside of all of this he screams in the middle of the night sometimes.. like screeches.. if I check on him he just wants his bed fluffed.. or more food.. but he doesnt really have personality anymore.. like hes just a shell walking around the house.. =""

I used to take him everywhere with me like my little travel buddy.. these days its because I dont trust someone else to take care of him how I know

I don't know if she'll ever fully get it. It breaks my heart to think that she just thinks that her sister, who has been there for her for every second of her life since I brought her home, is just suddenly gone and she doesn't know why.

I'm hoping when I get Hera's ashes in a few weeks, she'll recognize that her sister is truly no longer with us. She's scattered across us now like a million little snowflakes.

Thing is, my dogs are still a little nervous there following me everywhere, and whenever I had to leave the house for a while my sister told me they got nervous and started crying for me.   
While I do work from home so I'm with them most of the time, I leave for training every morning for a few hours so I can't be there the whole day (which is not a problem where I live now since obviously they're used to their home)  
How do I help them get more comfortable for the first days/weeks of living there so that they don't get too stressed when I'm out? Should I just ask my sister or her daughters to play with them to keep them busy when I'm gone?   
(To clarify, I can't skip training because I have a horse that needs exercising every day)

2023-10-24,1698165364,Researching my next HeartDog - Std. Poodle; Doberman or Vizsla? Any/all input/insight welcome.,"**\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\***

*  Std. Poodle; Doberman or Vizsla - I do enjoy a velcro dog. 
* I go camping a lot, so a dog that is people/dog neutral/friendly is probably best.
* I prefer a smarter dog. The difference in brainpower from a lab to a gsd was astounding to me. 
* Stubborn is okay (I know they often go hand in hand) just not Husky/Malamute/Greenland Dog stubborn.
* I am interested in the three title breeds mainly for the velcroness of the breed personality and because all three lean to the smarter side. Each breed has interesting characteristics and endearing qualities. Ultimately it will probably come down to train-ability and off-leash recall potential (aware each dog is different but some breeds are better than others with recall).
* I would love to hear from folks who have these breeds as part of their family.I am also moderately interested in certification for search and rescue (this is how I discovered Peps hip problems initially) but not a deal breaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\***

* Companion/friend/adventure buddy.  
* Possible search/rescue certification.

**\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\*** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?

\* I have raised/been raised by dogs my whole life. I am familiar with huskies, Yorkies, labs, gsds and Heinz-57 dogs.\* I have almost always been the primary caregiver of my dogs, even when I was a child.  I am married, my and my partner and my adult children would be part of the dog's life, but I would be the primary caregiver.\* I plan to do most of the training myself, certification training (canine good citizen/search and rescue, etc.) would be done with official trainers.\* Dogs have come into my life as puppies and as older dogs.  Every one of my dogs has passed of either old age or age-related disease/issues.  My Old English Lab passed from cancer.\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?\* I currently have three dogs and a cat.  This dog would not come into our lives until my heartdog passes.  There is no immediate timetable on that - probably within the next 2-4 years. two dogs are boxer/shepherd mixes aged three.  I have a six and a half year old GSD who has genetically terrible hips due to her mom coming from a byb situation - my GSD's mother was a pregnant rescue from an Amish area in PA.  The cat is 12 and may not be with us still when it's time to bring this new dog into our home.\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*\* No children in the home.  I have nephews and a niece that the dog would meet occasionally.  Part of my training would include introduction to children of various ages. It's part of the training I do with every dog I have.\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?\* We own our home with a fully fenced in back yard with an 8-food privacy fence.  We have NO plans to rent in the future. We DO have plans to move to wooded property with private hiking trails.\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?\* Myself, my partner and three adult children.  My partner is urging this research as my heartdog has mobility issues.  Every member of our family loves and interacts with our animals on a daily basis.\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*\* A few times a month - said visitors are \*rarely\* strangers, rather repeat friends and family who the dog will get to know over the course of it's puppy hood.\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*\* Most have been rescues. One was from a breeder. One from woman who showed her dogs professionally and only had litters for health reasons.

\* Normally I rescue. In this case I am thinking reputable breeder or another show situation.\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*\* I feel as though a puppy is my best venue based on the things I would like to train it for -- hiking/camping/off-leash recall/search and rescue.\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\]([http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg))\* Size does not matter to me one whit.  I know poodles come in four sizes - I would not be adverse to any of them.\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*\* 24/7 nonstop is too much.  Alert barking is fine.  Nervous ""what is that?"" barking is fine.  The dog will never be alone for more than four hour stretches (and that would happen maybe 1-3 times a year), so I am not too worried about anxiety barking.\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*\* Prefer not to do daily.

\* I dont care about coat maintenance but am concerned about thin coats/skin. Is this an issue for outdoors activities (hiking/kayaking)?\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.\* I am currently head to toe in GSD ""glitter"" so shedding is not an issue.\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*\* I would prefer to do grooming at home, I understand that a poodle has a steep learning curve, but I also have already been putting feelers out for groomers that other people's dogs like.  My aunt has a Briard who has a groomer he LOVES.\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*\* Slobber is not something I've had to deal with. I'd pass.\* Everyone farts.\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*\* Velcro, velcro, velcro please.  I already have a cat.\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*\* We'll be doing Canine Good Citizen, I hope for off-leash recall work for when we're thru hiking. Search and rescue (if the dog shows inclination). General good manners and good leash walking behavior.\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\*\* Can't or won't?  I  don't think I could tolerate indoor toileting issues if it weren't a medical thing. I also work really hard to avoid resource guarding.\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*\* Moderately important for hiking, privately owned area and allowed spaces ONLY.  It is NOT my intention to have a continually off-leash dog as it is unsafe for the dog.\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*\* I currently do three mile walks daily as well as hiking/outdoor activity on top of that.\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*\* I already have invested in puzzles and snuffle mats for my three shepherd/shepherd mixes.  I also hope the scent work will help with this.  So lots of time.\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*\* I offer crates for my dogs, but they are allowed to sleep with me.  Whether or not the dog will be crated when we leave will depend entirely on the dog, the crate will be available regardless.\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*\* Maybe 4 hours maximum 1-3 times per year.\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*\* Yes\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).\* USA Northeast Coast\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live?

2023-10-24,1698165071,Hard decision to euthanize our dog due to age/medical and severe anxiety.,"I'm posting this here in case anyone else is in the same situation so they can get insight from my experience. Also, looking to hear from anyone who went through this same thing so I can get some relief from my grief. I'm sure there will be a majority of the posts calling me a monster or something to that effect.  
  
We made the difficult decision to have Rover euthanized due to moderate age issues and extreme separation anxiety.  
  
Trying to be as brief as possible with a story that spans 10 years. In short this is a very sweet dog who loved humans, disliked other dogs and needed to be with a human 24/7 or she would destroy and escape from wherever she was at.  
  
We dropped Rover off on Friday morning at a Pet Resort for a two night stay with a pickup on Sunday between 3-5pm. We put her in there so we could enjoy 48 hours of escape during our vacation to visit out grandchildren. Rover is 13.5 years old and has severe separation anxiety. Her anxiety has increased over the past five years to the point that my wife and I have been tag teaming with each other so someone is always with her. We have had success with this particular Pet Resort however we have only been leaving her there for day care and/or one night on the weekend. This was our first attempt at two nights in a row. During the day with humans around she is fine. At night they put the dogs in rooms in groups of two so they have a ""buddy"" and don't feel alone. Rover is only interested in human company.  
  
We got a call from the Pet Resort early Sunday morning. They told us that Saturday night she tore through two wooden doors (those cheap ones what are a frame with 1/4 inch panel on each side), opened several other doors, opened a sliding glass door that no other dog has ever opened and got herself caught up in a chain link fence. They found her inside Sunday morning with blood everywhere. The fence tore a 1"" hole in her hind leg that was pretty deep. They were going to take her to an emergency vet (only place open on a Sunday) and asked us to meet them there. When we got there Rover was laying on the floor on a blanket and would not get up. In addition to the leg wound she also had a huge hot spot on the side of her face where she had apparently been scratching non stop for hours. She looked like a prisoner of war. She looked like she had just given up and just wanted to sleep/rest/etc. The Resort owner felt really bad for the damage Rover had done to herself. We comforted her and told her it was not her fault. Rover loves it there... she just freaks out when humans leave and will kill herself trying to get back to a human.  
  
My wife and I have been watching Rover over the past several years as she entered the ""old dog"" phase. She is covered in fatty lumps (no issue), she sleeps ALL THE TIME, she has minor incontinance. She is on meds for arthritis and should probably be on pain pills and anxiety meds too. We tried anxiety meds a few months back and it was horrible. I know there are other meds out there we should try, but we don't believe in giving a dog multiple drugs a day just so they can not enjoy life but at least be breathing. What kind of life is it if you are loopy from drugs and you just lay around and sleep all day? We have had three dogs before Rover and we have had to put down dogs for old age in the past. Our normal situation is to wait TOO LONG because we can't make the decision at the right time. We've prolonged a dogs suffering before and told ourselves we would not do it again.  
  
So - our options this past Sunday were to either to make the hard decision to euthanize her OR we could get her x-rayed, put under for minor surgery/stitches on her leg, then pain killers and other medications for infections... a cone on her head until she healed. She had hot spots a few months back and we know she has to wear a cone until she is 100% healed or she will chew up every scab/sore until she is bleeding in less than 2 minutes. So, we knew that getting her stitched up and healed was going to be many weeks of wearing a cone and being under constant supervision. Then, after all that she is still an elder dog who probably has another 2-10 months of life left before she will have even more symptoms that warrent being euthanized. We feel that is a lot to put a dog through when (a) they have enjoyed 90% of their live and are close to the end (b) their quality of life is already low.  
  
I think most of my guilt comes from the fact that anyone looking at Rover would think she is five years younger and has lots of life left in her. It actually shows her extreme her anxiety is that she can go from a dog that does nothing but sleep all day to a beast capable of going through wooden doors and tearing plywood away just to escape. We have also put our life on hold for over 2 years just to make sure that she is safe and comfortable. Also, it's not fair to people like this Pet Resort owner to have a dog visit who literally destroys her facility.",dogs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17fgxgi/hard_decision_to_euthanize_our_dog_due_to/

2023-10-24,1698153334,Advice on adopting a dog,"Hello!, 

I have never had a dog in my family before, only cats, lots and lots of cats lol. 

I really, really want to adopt a dog, and am feeling a bit lost. I hope someone here can give me some advice. 

Me and my long-term boyfriend bought a house together early in the year. We have no kids(yet), and both work. Because of this, I really think adopting an older dog would be best. Because they wouldn't need as much attention. And by that I just mean, they wouldn't be as hyper and need as much training and that sort of thing, I know an older dog also needs tons of attention, just in a different, more peaceful way that I think we'd be better at providing right now.

But, there are hardly ever any older small/medium sized dogs up for adoption in my area, only ever puppies and very large dogs which would be hard with the layout of our house, especially if they can't go up stairs and whatnot as the stairs to our bedroom are quite steep =+ 

I guess I'm just a bit lost because, maybe we could handle a puppy/young dog? My boyfriend works every day pretty early, and I work nights (usually) at a bar so I pretty much leave when my boyfriend is coming home, so there would usually be someone home most of the time! Except, when I do work the odd day shift I leave at like 9am and don't get back till 5 or 6, so that really wouldn't be okay for a young dog. I don't know. I just do not want to make a dogs life unfair who really deserves the best. 

Do you guys think I should just hold out and keep checking the shelters for an older smaller dog? Should I maybe call the shelters and let them know I'm looking for one? Just incase one comes in? Or should I just not adopt one all together and wait? 

That would be really sad to me, I feel like we have SO much love to give and would be such an incredible home for a dog that needs it. But if it was going to be unfair to the dog AT ALL I wouldn't do it either =+ I should add my boyfriend has always had dogs, and I have cared for many in my life, just never had one as part of my family unfortunately.

1) as soon as you realize your dog ate something poisonous call the ASPCA Poison Hotline. They make you pay ~$90 one time fee but its 100% worth it. We took our dog to the vet and they make you do this anyways because they work with the poison control experts to come up with a plan 
2) theyll want to know what type of poison they consumed, how much they consumed and your dogs weight. if you know exactly what ingredient is in the poison it can help them figure out what to do, so try to call pest control company who put out rodenticide or find the packaging if you bought it yourself. If you cant get in touch with the pest company (weekend etc) email them and explain the situation, they called us back first thing the next day (a Sunday) because they wanted to help and felt horrible 
3) if the ASPCA  poison control suggest you take your dog to the vet, do it immediately. This part is super important because literally every minute counts. They will likely use medicine to make your dog vomit so the sooner you get there the better.

Last night she then climbed in to bed to sleep overnight, which didn't go great - i mean it was great for her, but i tend to shift around a lot to get comfortable and the restriction on my movement made that awkward and at one point i got up to go to the bathroom and came back to find she'd draped herself straight across the middle of the bed.

2023-10-23,1698104783,"First Heat Cycle, Puppy Potty Issues","Hello!

(Waiting to spay until 2 years old due to research stating it's best to wait)

&amp;#x200B;

My 8 month golden retriever recently started her first heat cycle. She was bleeding a lot and not licking it all up so we put her in a cloth dog diaper (changing it and the pad inside it multiple times a day). However, the issue is she won't notify us that she has to potty anymore. She hasn't had an accident inside so I assume she's just holding it. We removed the diaper today after about 5 days of wearing it and she's still not notifying us that she needs to potty. Is this normal behavior? We have her out of the diaper now because the bleeding has subsided, or she's been better at licking up the blood. before it gets everywhere. Her vulva is still really engorged, so I know she's still in heat.

&amp;#x200B;

2023-10-24,1698134329,Is my dog bullying?,"My partner and I regularly take his dog (border collie, 2.5 years old, female...not particularly well socialised as a puppy) to my parents' house when we visit. They have three dogs, two male springer spaniels who're around 3.5 years old, and a female collie/lab mix who's about 4.5 years old.   
  
Recently, our dog has become ***obsessed*** with the collie/lab mix and displays bully-like behaviour. She almost always puts her face right up in the other dog's face, she stands over her, nips her ears, blocks her from getting close to us, growls at her etc. and when my parents' dog has had enough, she bites back and a proper fight breaks out. If either of us claps or fusses over the other dog, she immediately comes very close to her and they both start growling.  
  
It's almost impossible to get her to stop, even if you physically block her, she'll do anything to get close to the other dog. It's honestly like she's possessed! She doesn't do this with the other dogs, and she's otherwise generally well behaved.  
  
Initially we tried to ignore it, thinking that maybe this was them working out some dominance-related issues that they'd resolve between themselves, but it seems to be getting more intense. Furthermore, because we're confused as to what the behaviour is about, we don't respond to it in a consistent way.  
  
Any help or advice would be much appreciated. What's the explanation for this behaviour? Is it bullying? What's the best method for correcting the behaviour?",dogs,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17f7ji8/is_my_dog_bullying/
2023-10-24,1698146666,Female dogs takes forever to pee,"Hi so it has been very difficult to handle my almost 1year old dogs peeing schedule for a couple of weeks/month.
She started taking forever to pee (up to 1h), and most often at night (11pm)
We ve tried multiple methods but its exhausting honestly i dont have time or the energy to walk her 50 times a day anymore that was okay when she was a little puppy.
I dont what i should do, should i just walk her 15mins and wait till her next walk if she doesnt pee. Normally she has a big 1hour walk during the day but currently she has an eye problem so we cant do that but thus problem occured way before that
Her walks are usually : 
 7/8 am 
 12/13pm
5:30/6:30
10/11:30

So if we skip one it might make her wait 10hours to pee or like 14hours at night which seems unhealthy.
She is a 9kg cocker spaniel so quite small she doesnt have a big bladder

Also i am not too fond of this idea bc she had a few accidents recently most likely bc of a medication but still (she is off of it now)

Anyway it makes me so frustrated when i have to wait 45mins before i can go home

Wouldnt it be best to remove « tradition bias » (for example, those who want to preserve breed traits which are not in the dogs best interests purely for the sake of tradition and conservation) from influencing criteria? Breeders dont always have the best interest of their animals at heart (plenty of « reputable » breeders who produce show animals and are akc registered have been caught treating their animals like garbage.) and have often been guilty of breeding dogs to extreme standards which are not what is best for the animals. 

Veterinarians have access to research, experience, and evidence, as well as being those who treat health issues when they do come up.

We would preffer a dog on the smaller size, and one that does not shed a whole lot (preferabbly not hairless).  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* We are interested in toy dog but any small/medium dogs that meet our criteria work for us :D

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Snuggly  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* A gentle response, going up to the door is fine and greeting them but we dont want much agression.

2023-10-23,1698099167,"We have two dogs, need urgent help","Okay, one dog, a Lhasa Apso, recently had a stroke. She's still active but sleeping a lot theough the day because my oarents don't let her go downstairs next to the bigger dog and she's kind of just stuck in my room. She doesn't show any signs of depression but I have OCD and feel like a terrible owner due to struggling to take care of her such was walking and brushing, bathing , etc but I want to dk betterfor her. I want to know if there's something I can do such as making a routine for her? She isn't very playful, she's 10 yrs old and a rescue dog that used to be used for breeding, she gets cuddled, gets food and I try to fill up her water bowl but worry I'm going to poison her with the soap in it. I got oje of those auto water dispensers but the water just seems dirty. I tried getting her shaved the other day but she moves around too much and because of my OCD I'm worried about hurting her. I worry she's sleeping too much and I'm not doing a gokd job and I'm debating givinf her to someoen else but i don't think that's right as she's already been passed on a lot. She's not very keen to learn either (It took my 2 years to teach her PAW which i did with her everyday until she learned it)

We have another dog too which is either a Staffordshire bull terrier, an xl bully, or a pitbull. It's hard to tell. He's 2 years old has incredibly destructive behavior as he's overwhelmingly happy when just anyone comes through the door, he'll throw himself at them and run around like a lunatic for up to 20 mins. This dog isn't owned by me but someone else in the house. I've tried to train him but the owner won't lwt me because that ""doesn't work for her breed"" even when I've successfully trained him in the past. For some reason he's terrified of anything that moves such as brushes for some reason. We've had to use the brush before to stop him from attacking or lunging at people (we didn't hurt him woth it, we jsut gave the brush to someones to hold which I know is bad. Some of my siblings have chased himaround with the brush. I did this once or twiceint the past too i think but I would have been about 15 and have learned not to since then which i know was stupid of me and I'm sorry for those acrions, deeply. I'd never hurt him on purpose though.) He's freakishly strong too, it requires two people to walk him, each with one lead around a harness. I tried using a gentle leader but people kept telling me not to. We have a few neighbors that come over and I saw one slap him the other daywhich I was appaled by! He has a strange habit too that whenever's her wants tl see someowne, he places their arms into his mouth and gebtly bitws down but we don't know why. He manages to stop himself from doing this by getting a toy in his mouth or a blnaket.

What should I do? I can't take the guilt of having my own dog anymore and I feel like an awful person. I'm open to all suggestions!! I want to improve for both the dogs and help them anyway I can. We have been debating getting rid of the bigger dog to a more stable family, he isn't scared of us or anything, he's just too big and destructive to be kept in our house.

2023-10-23,1698104901,Dog breed?,"Hello all, Im not getting a dog anytime soon but I will be in about five years. And I want to make sure I can do plenty of research and be prepared before I get the dog Im currently 15 so Ill get them when Im about 19-21


**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog I own on my own, I currently have a family dog that everyone takes care of, however I was in charge of all training. 

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

I dont really mind but I will probably get a rescue. Unless this dog becomes a prospect for an assistant dog (I have a physical disability and some mental autism, depression, ADHD, anxiety ect ect) 

3. Describe your ideal dog.

Cuddly but also able to entertain themselves with toys, puzzles, ect. Easy to train, loyal


4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

My top three are Great Dane, GreyHound, and Chihuahua big difference I know, Ive loved greyhounds since I was 8 years old and almost adopted one, my family friend have two Great Danes and I cant get enough of them they are amazing and the perfect sizes and I just love chihuahuas they are tiny dogs with big personalities and I love them. I might just get all three.


5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience is a big one, as well as heel, recall, and if they become an assistance dog there will be tasks. 

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, unless assistance dog counts

**Care Commitments**

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Two 45-1 long walks or outside time, then probably 1 and a half hours of play, and then puzzles lick mats, and that sort of thing

See above 

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Depending on the coat, daily brush, bath ever two weeks, and every two months or so depending on the coat a professional groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

10. What size dog are you looking for?

Large, or small I really dont care but I really like big dogs 

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding and slobber is fine, barking is okay but not 24/7 if its like started for a bit, and then they calm down its okay 

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not very important but I would like some sort of recall, as I will be doing lots of long line walking, sniff walks, ect 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Both, like I want them to be curly but I also want them to be able to entertain them self sometimes

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?


Both

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would like them to be friendly, but barking is okay, as long as they settle dog 


16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I would not outwardly go for a reactive dog but if something happens then I would stick with them and try and help them.


17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I dont think so 

**Lifestyle**

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

When I get the dog I would be in tafe or uni (im planing on doing both, TAFE than uni) studying to become a teacher, I would be doing part time two or three days a week for probably 4-6 hours. And then the rest of the week I would be working for 6 hours. But other than work I wouldnt be leaving the house regularly 

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?


I would probably have roommate but I would be the one looking after the dog

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?


21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

I live in an area with lots of kids, but I do not want kids of my own.


22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?


Yes I will be renting for at least 10 years, but my parents own rental properties one with a large yard, so I will probably be renting from them.

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Australia, Im not aware of the banned breeds, but I know these three breeds are not banned 

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

2023-10-24,1698107744,My dog my be a little too obsessed with other dogs,"So I have a 7 month old black Labrador and he is an absolute treat. He is learning to walk on the lead and has struggled to not tug or worse completely lunge. This is especially bad with other dogs. When he sees one in public its like he loses everything he knows. He will stand right up to try and get near them as much as possible, just constantly pull on the lead. Im quite concerned he hurts himself pulling so hard against the lead. I get him to sit, and he has come a long way to be fair, but he still cant help himself and you can tell he will rocket off as soon as he is given any excuse to move. I have recently tried heel-turning when he gets like this because I was told it would reset his brain and make him less excited or begin to associate acting this way with not getting nearer the other dog. But the only thing that works is waiting until they are gone. 

Ill be clear I always make a point to ask people if he can say hello. In the park off the lead with friendly dogs he just doesnt leave them alone. There is a grey hound shelter nearby and he will exhaust himself just chasing after them non-stop even while they completely ignore him. Hes just sniffing and sniffing them. 

All he wants to do is play. Its all he cares about.

My friend came round for the weekend and brought her similar-age golden retriever and it was a bit of a problem to be honest. My dog just wouldnt leave him alone even when given lots of social cues to back off. Hed just follow him around like a shadow. 

Can anyone explain this behaviour and maybe give some advice about how to socialise him a bit better? I feel like Im just indulging in what might develop into really problematic behaviour later on.

*This will be my first dog of my own, I had a family dog growing up, she was a yellow lab.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to rescue my dog.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Ideally, I would like to get a big dog that is cuddly and loving, active enough to go on one long walk every day, but not so active that its a lot to handle. It is also important to me that I think the dog is cute. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
1. Pit bulls - so cute, so sweet and loving

For a few reasons, I like to walk my dog in the open desert lots between neighborhoods, mainly for the sense of solitude.

I suspect there is Coyote activity in these areas, and we have spotted them, maybe 5 times in 2.5 years.

Sometimes my pup alerts me first, via a change in body language, other times I notice them first.

The closest a Coyote ever came to us was about 25ish feet and it was an escort situation. I have no reason to suspect any wild dog activity in these areas.

My question is, when I start to take my dog onto these areas, he stalls, and sometimes even lays down, like, 'I'm not going any further'. This is totally not like him, and, so, I reroute us back to the neighborhood streets...

Could the smell of Coyotes be deterring my dog from wanting to walk here? Can a dog smell when, perhaps there is more than one nearby, as in the case of a den?

While I'm quite certain that I want to choose one of these two breeds, I was hoping for further feedback on which one aligns better with my lifestyle.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I have previous experience owning and training family dogs, but this will be the first dog I will have sole responsibility for. I've had the opportunity to walk dogs, which has allowed me to interact with a wide range of breeds, including toy breeds and hounds.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

I prefer choosing a reputable breeder because I would like to have a good understanding of the dog's history, but if an opportunity to rescue a Chihuahua or Dachshund occurred, I would consider it.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

I'm in search of a small breed with moderate energy levels that can comfortably adapt to a small living space. Furthermore, I'm looking for a dog that will develop a strong bond with me and actively engage in interaction and companionship.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I'm interested in the Chihuahua and Miniature Dachshund. It seems that both breeds meet a lot of my requirements, and I love their curious and alert personalities. Their adaptability regarding energy levels is also a plus. However, when it comes to Miniature Dachshunds, I'm cautious about the potential risk of IVDD as that seems to be a big issue within the breed.

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I plan to focus on teaching the basics like sit, down, stay, come, and so on.

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

7. How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm fully committed to dedicating as much time as necessary to care for and train this dog.

8. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I can commit to around 60-90 minutes of daily exercise, mainly involving walks and activities like fetch.

9. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I think Ill opt for the smooth coat variety of the breed I choose as I'd like to avoid high grooming needs.

**Personal Preferences**

10. What size dog are you looking for?

Small

11. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I'm prepared to handle barking, slobber, and shedding. From my understanding, both Chihuahuas and Dachshunds can be pretty vocal, which I don't mind. However, I'm curious if this is more of a nature or nurture matter - Can training effectively reduce barking behaviour in these breeds?

12. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13. Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I dont mind. Whatever the dog is comfortable with.

14. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

I'm okay with an independent dog, but some level of engagement would be nice.

15. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'm fine with some alert barking.

16. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'm fine with my dog being independent and not necessarily seeking interaction with other dogs, but I want to avoid any aggression issues.

17. Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

No.

**Lifestyle**

18. How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

No more than an hour.

19. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

They dont have any additional preferences.

20. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We have a cat, but have no intentions of adding any other animals.

21. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Young family members occasionally visit, but aside from that, not really.

22. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No.

23. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

There are a few banned breeds here in the UK, but I have no interest in owning them.

24. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winter - 1°C to 7°C (34°F to 45°F)

Summer - 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F)

I am somewhat concerned about the sensitivity of both Chihuahuas and Dachshunds to cold weather, especially when it comes to toilet-training. I would prefer to avoid using puppy-pads if possible.",dogs,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17em8je/is_the_chihuahua_or_miniature_dachshund_a_better/

2023-10-23,1698063571,Medium size and energy breed recommendation!,"Introduction  
Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\- No, we have a 3 year old rescue boxer/lab/husky that we've taken to obedience school and continued to try to implement the lessons from that school.  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?  
\- Reputable breeder  
Describe your ideal dog.  
\- An ideal dog for us is medium sized and medium energy needs. Enough to play with current dog and run in the yard and a couple of walks throughout the day, but also happy to relax on the couch in between. It would be preferable if it had a coat that was relatively easy to care for, brushing is no problem, but would prefer not to need to take it to the groomer. Bonus points if it's biddable, we've struggled with current dog to teach anything beyond the basics. We would prefer if the dog was rather quiet, barking on occassion but not for everything.   
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\- We've looked at some breeds but all seem to be missing something or have too much energy. We've researched Tollers, Welsh Springers, Brittanies, Australian Shepherds, and of course Golden and Labrador Retrievers among others.  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\- As mentioned above it would be ideal to easily train basic commands and recall, but also fetch, hide/seek games, and be able to attend advanced obedience trainings  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\- I personally would love to be able to try agility or herding (but herding breeds probably aren't right for us based on some basic research/reputation)  
Care Commitments  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\- 4 hours is probably our limit  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
\- A couple of hours of walks and play time in our garden. Additional hikes and adventures on the weekends.  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\- Minimal grooming needs would be prefered. I would be happy to brush daily/weekly and clean ears. Hair cuts are not something we'd like to deal with either ourselves or with a groomer.  
Personal Preferences  
10) What size dog are you looking for?  
\- Medium. 30-60 pounds, 20-24 inches would be ideal but this is certainly flexible.  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\- Shedding is no issue. Barking would ideally be kept to a minimum (delivery people, strangers, etc all fine to bark at). Slobber isn't a concern.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\- This is fairly important to us, we'd be devoting a lot of time to training recall.   
Dog Personality and Behavior  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\- Some personal space is fine by us, but not completely aloof. We love when our current dog decides she wants to cuddle with us. The fact she doesn't do it all the time makes it more special.  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
Again, a happy medium would be ideal. We worry a dog that's completely focused on us wouldn't be happy during the day. I work from home, but am often in meetings where it would need to entertain itself with our current dog.  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
\- Some alert barking is okay, with generally aloofness when we accept the visitors in.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\- No, we're trying to avoid dog aggressive breeds.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\- Biting as an adolescent/adult  
Lifestyle  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\- Minimally, I work from home. We occassionally go out for dinner without our dog but that's limited to up to 2 times a week maximum. Otherwise we take our dog everywhere we can.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  
\- Wife and I completely coordinating and by and large in agreement on needs thankfully!  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  
\- We have one 3-year-old boxer/gsd/husky  rescue. We would ideally get chickens or ducks in the next few years.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\- Hopefully. We have no children now but they are in the plans for the next few years.  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\- We currently rent, no restrictions.  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\- I don't believe there are any applicable.  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\- Summers are low 80s average, peaking in the high 90s on occassion. Winters are cold and snowy.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-10-23,1698036582,"Living with very affectionate dog, but feel anxious around dogs - advice for how to discourage some behaviours?","I've been renting a place for the past year with a friend who has a dog. I don't feel very comfortable around dogs (had one try to attack me as a kid, no permanent injuries but I do get a bit stressed around them now) so I made clear from day 1 I wanted very little to do with the dog. I trusted the dog's owner and my other roommate, who loves dogs, to know what to do. I've helped out a couple times (taken her on a couple walks, played fetch in the backyard a few times) but otherwise besides the occasional pat I have not been involved in her life at all.  


It's now been nearly one year since we got her, and while her behaviour isn't awful, she's still a bit poorly behaved, and since I'm not a dog person I don't know if this is normal behaviour for a dog of her age. She'll try and bite my hand to get my attention if I'm trying to work on stuff, and she'll try and greet me by jumping on me - neither of which I particularly enjoy. It's not helped by the fact she's actually quite a large dog, so she's fully knocked me backwards a couple times, and nearly broken my laptop a few times too. She's also quite loud and barks a lot to try and get my attention and to try and get me to spend time with her. She's very energetic, so she'll try and bark at my window to get me to play with her at 11 or midnight (assuming her owner's still out at work), while I'm trying to get some sleep or study for uni exams! It's gotten to the point I'll actively avoid going home as long as possible some days to try and avoid her - which sucks because she's otherwise a very sweet dog, but she just puts me on edge!  


I've never had a dog before, and I'll be living with this one for the next two years most likely, so I guess I want to know if this behaviour will calm down with age, or if there's anything I can do to try and get her to stop biting, barking, jumping on me, or just help her sleep at night. If this is normal for her age, any tips for how to get less anxious around dogs? Or, worst case scenario, advice on how to get her to just ignore me in the house?  
Thanks for any advice! And sorry I'm not much of a dog person - I'm certain all of your pets are absolutely lovely &lt;3 ",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17echkr/living_with_very_affectionate_dog_but_feel/

2023-10-27,1698384165,My dog killed my neighbors cat in California,"While me and my family were gone today the neighbors cat found its way into our yard. It was apparently killed. They told us their indoor cat snuck out of the house and they believed from one of the holes dug by our dogs believed it was snatched to the other side by our dogs and killed. Their words were we think the cat was curious and looked under the fence to see what was on the other side and was attacked  and when asked since they have cameras why not look to see exactly how she got into our yard they didnt wanna look at the footage of their cat being killed. All this was discussed after the husband without our permission went into our backyard to retrieve the dead cat while we werent home to then only tell us how dangerous one of our rehomed huskies is because he protected the dead cat when he tried to get close to it. I was confused by like a fresh kill and that the dogs behavior would escalate and get worse and wanted the animal gone. While being told this Im confused at why hed thought it would be ok to trespass on my property. And then mention potentially calling the county.  While I understand being upset with what happened. Told us it would basically be in our best interest just to rehome our huskies after the loss of his cat coming onto our property and him trespassing.

2023-10-27,1698390439,Senior dog being alone during work hours,"Hi Reddit.

About 6 months ago I took in a senior dog, approximately ten years old, mix, mostly German Shepherd. Pretty good health, except worn out hips and knees. He's on pain medication and we're advised to not walk longer than 20 minutes at a time.

My workplace is near my home so I have arranged that on my lunch break I go home to walk the dog. I live in an apartment, the dog, as far as known, only lived in apartments. I have been wanting to move, to a house with a garden.

I have a house in mind, only this one is further away from my workplace making it more inconvenient (not impossible) to walk him at noon.

He doesn't like to get up in the morning, so on my days off, if I let him, he will sleep till around 08:00. The last walk on the evening prior was around 21:00.

Normally I am against leaving a dog alone all day. But now I'm wondering and therefore turn to Reddit.

Is it okay for a sleepy senior be alone for about nine hours? I wonder about his notion of time. Would it be more inconvenient for him that I come home at noon but also leave again (which he doesn't like), or is it better for him to be alone at 1 stretch in that regard?

Thank you in advance.",dogs,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17hhsuc/senior_dog_being_alone_during_work_hours/

2023-10-27,1698408149,Dog won't let me sleep-please help,"Hello reddit - kind of weird one for you.

We got our dog (4 y.o. male basenji) about 3.5 years ago. I was on birth control the whole time, never had a period. I went off bc, got pregnant immediately, so still never had a period.

Had the baby 10 weeks ago and my period just came back. This is the first time my dog has experienced me having a period and he will not leave me alone. If I'm out of his sight, he cries and whines incessantly.

The biggest issue is that our baby sleeps in our bedroom still, in a bassinet beside our bed that our dog could easily get into. He's great with the baby, but I could absolutely see a tragic accident happening while my husband and I sleep from him just wanting to snuggle. So he's not allowed in the bedroom while we're asleep. Which means I'm banished to the uncomfortable couch, because neither of us can sleep when our dog crying non-stop outside our door.

Has anyone dealt with this? Does it at least get better? Is there a way to train our dog to understand I'm not in danger?",dogs,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17hlzi0/dog_wont_let_me_sleepplease_help/

2023-10-27,1698412372,Is this a Normal Schedule?,"Hello! I posted here last week about potty training and most of you recommended to get rid of the pee pads, do more crate training, and keep him to a regular schedule. All of this has worked wonders in his potty training, so thank you all!  

Im at the end of Week 2 with my pup right now (hes coming up on 3 months of age) and have been following the below routine for him on a daily basis this week. I wanted to know if this is a good schedule for him as I dont want him to feel too neglected. Im also curious to know when I should maybe switch up his routine as he gets older?



6 am: Let him out to pee/poo. 

7:30 am: Take him out for a quick 15 min walk. He usually pees/poos again. Come back and play with him until 8 am. 

8 am: Feed him in his crate. Sometimes he doesnt finish his food until I sit next to him or take the food outside (some suggestions here would also be nice!)

8:15 am - 8:45 am: Put him in the play pen and play with him for a bit or let him play with his toys while I prep for the day. 

8:45 am: Take him out before I start work at 9 am. 

9 am - 12 pm: Let him play in his playpen. Ill occasionally take a quick 5 minute break from work to check up on him (hes in a playpen right next to me) and play with him. Ill also take him out about 1-2 times during this time period. 

12 pm - 4 pm: Feed him, then same routine as 9 am - 12 pm. 

4 pm: Feed him. 

5 pm - 9:30 pm: Let him out to pee/poo then let him play in the playpen while my bf and I relax and prep dinner. 

9:30 pm: Take him out for one last walk before bed. 


As you guys can see, I try to dedicate as much play time as I can with him, but I also get tired towards the end of the day. I work from home and my bf works on-site so the majority of the puppy caring falls onto me, which makes me very tired.

We tried everything possible in the 2 days to try and get her better but it was very sudden. She was getting out of breath constantly. 

My sister who has always been by her side sensed something was wrong and asked our parents - who were traveling at the time - to come back immediately. Mom came a day before and dad came a few hours before she passed away. Our family cousins also made it to see her one last time. 

Even in the last few hours- in pain, she stood up and wagged her tail for them, and was happy to see them, my little angel. 

She never had anything but love for the world and its people. And she was loved and cared for until the end. 

I miss her so much. I could not see her as i was 7000 miles away. I will carry this grief with me for a long time. I brought her into our home and she filled it with love- and I couldnt be there in her last days but i hope she knows i love her a lot and will forgive me for not being there.

2023-10-26,1698359988,"10 year old yorkie started acting weird sometimes, usually at night","To get this out of the way: The vet is aware. Ive sent in videos and discussed over the phone, however, he says he cant do anything from the video because its practically useless. If nothing yields here, I will drive her the 3 hours to an appointment. 

About 3 years ago, my yorkie developed some weird growth on the top of her head, in between her ears. It started out as an itchy patch that grew within 3 years to be the size of a table-tennis ball. It was diagnosed as a benign Mast Cell Tumor and it was removed 6 months ago.        
About 10 months ago, my dog started acting extremely weird at certain points throughout the day. It was originally an occasional, 2-3 times a week, ordeal, however, recently its starting to become more frequent like once a day, usually at night. At first I attributed it to the thing on her head and just convinced myself the vet was wrong, the ball on her head wasnt benign, it was actually harmful; but that wasnt the case, as we had it removed and the behavior has stayed consistent. 

I cant post videos here, so Ill try to explain it as best as I can:        
Usually, shes your ordinary 10 year old yorkie, maybe even a bit more spunky. She gets all excited when she sees her humans, a bit violent when she sees other dogs, and all tail-waggy-yippee when you call her name or give her attention.       
When she gets in these weird modes she wont even really acknowledge you&.     
She refuses to lay on the tile. Theres a few rugs placed throughout the house so every 10 minutes or so shell switch rugs.      
She lays flat with her head on her two front paws.     
Her breathing looks deformed and forced.      
She twitches her back right leg every 3 seconds or so and sticks her tongue out like a frog every 1-2 seconds.       
Shes whimpers and whines quietly, but its already quiet here, so I hear her (and its annoying.).         
She chews her paws and the middle area of her back, right above her tail, until shes soaking wet.      
Her ears are steadily up. If you call her name she perks up a little bit and looks at you from the side but she wont pick her head up and look at you and she doesnt wag her tail.       
She acts like she cant acknowledge you, like its not physically possible for her, but the instant you say Lizzy (her enemy, lizards) she perks her head up and looks right at you.       
Its odd and super weird to see, but theres nothing so can do for her. Ive tried to feed her people food (her Heaven on earth), pick her up to love on her, let her sit with me, etc. but to no avail; she just runs away from me.         
If youre not around her constantly, then the difference wouldnt be noticeable, which is why the vet cant do anything with the videos I sent him.  She just looks like shes laying there chilling, but if you pay attention to her and know her usual behavior, its sad to watch. She looks stuck.       

Nothing has changed in her routine since this started happening: no food changes, same house, same people, same day-to-day, etc.

If they need to be cared for I dont mind brushing them or refilling their water bowls and stuff like that.

That being said, I am staying with my family who has three dogs. They are all fairly small dogs. I get along well with two of them, they are even friendly and affectionate towards me. The other one (it is at least part chihuahua), however, does not like me (or others, really, besides my mom and dad). It will bark at me if I enter the room, it will come into my room for the sole purpose just to bark at me, it will chase and nip at me. I do not antagonize the dog, nor do I even really attempt to do anything like touch it. I avoid eye contact as I read that you shouldnt if the dog is afraid of you?

2023-10-26,1698361862,[Breeds] First time puppy,"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have some experience puppysitting but have never had my own dog.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

* I am planning to go through a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* I wand a cuddly companion that I can bring along on occasional hikes (2 - 4 hours through forests, around lakes, etc.) and for very leisurely jogs of up to 5k 2 - 3 times a week.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have tried to do research (I'm a planner) and am stomped on what breeds are really suitable. In terms of looks, I love Caucasian Ovcharkas or Malamutes but these are neither suitable to my climate, nor would I be able or experienced enough to provide enough enrichment and training.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I plan on doing continuous obedience training for basic commands and so the dog can safely be brought along to friends and family and on hikes and such. I am not interested in tricks or show style training.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, other than the aforementioned mild jogging and hiking.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I expect school / intensive training 1 - 3 times a week during the first few months, slowly tapering off to once a week once the pup is grown. I plan on bringing the dog along for most things. The only regular occurrence where they won't be able to accompany me will be to the grocery shopping. During this time and other occassions that may pop up, such as doctor's visits, I have two next door neighbors who are experienced with dogs that would be willing to puppysit. My sister and brother in law are willing to step in in case I need a sitter for a prolonged period of time. I am able to dedicate an additional hour or so every day to focused playtime.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*  I will have time for at least two 30 - 60 minute walks every morning and evening and a shorter walk of 15 - 30 minutes around mid day. I work from home and my work is very dog friendly willing to accommodate regular potty breaks during the first months. As mentioned above, I go for leisurely runs 2 - 3 times a week, usually 4 - 5k in length. I would love to bring the dog along with me once they are grown. Every second weekend or so, I like to drive out into the country and take hikes in the surrounding area. These are usually between 10 - 20k in length and nothing extreme in terms of difficulty of terrain.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to brush daily and have no problem with cleaning ears, trimming nails, etc. However, if the breed is very grooming intensive, I would prefer to bring them to a professional to ensure it is done properly.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* My sister and brother in law have a German Shepherd and I would prefer a breed that is at least about that size.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I do not mind shedding, slobber is okay but I'd prefer if there wasn't an absolutely excessive amount. I would strongly prefer as little barking as possible.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be lovely if possible. I would prefer low prey drive.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly 100%

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* I am okay with a bit of a stubborn butthead so long as they listen when it counts. However, I feel that as a first time owner, an eager-to-please dog would be easier and safer to handle.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Tail wagging eagerness. My friends and neighbors are lovely and if anybody wants to rob the place, my dog's safety is more important to me than a couple lost possessions.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would strongly prefer not to and would probably seek professional help from a trainer if my dog turned out to have such a temperament.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* My 90 year old nana shares the house, though we live in two separate apartments. She is scared of dogs due to her leg being mauled when she was a small child, but has recently come around / gotten better because my sister and brother in law have gotten a German Shepherd puppy who she has been able to watch grow. However, she is still not very confident around dogs, so aggressive behavior would be an absolute no-no. The dog doesn't have to be around her if it can't be helped, but I would love her to share in the experience.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work from home and my hobbies are hiking, jogging, reading and gaming. The only regular thing I can think of where I won't be able to bring the dog along is grocery shopping and I can have those delivered if need be. I also have two next door neighbors who are experienced with dogs and willing to help out with sitting if need be. My sister and brother in law live an hour away and would be willing to help out with longer puppysitting duties in case of medical emergencies on my part or any unexpected trips or such.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* As mentioned above, my nana is a little scared of dogs but slowly coming around. She will not be involved in caring for the dog at all but I would love for her to be able to maybe come along on short walks, play with the dog in our garden or snuggle with them on her couch.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I do not have any other pets and do not plan on getting any.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* We have several young children in the neighborhood whom the dog would interact with on walks. My cousin has a seven year old daughter who comes by occasionally.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I live in a house my family owns that I'm also part owner of. When my nana passes, my cousins and I will be inheriting the rest of the house and property and plan to sell it. I plan on purchasing a smaller home out in the country when that time comes. No rent planned.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in Bavaria, Germany in a small town.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Average high during the summer months is around 22 - 24°C but we've recently experienced peaks in the mid thirties. Our winters are usually right around freezing +/- 2 or 3 degrees on average but as low as -10°C isn't unheard of.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

He is just over 1.5yrs old so they believe he likely got it as a puppy before he was in the shelter and it didnt show up during that test and the heartgard wasnt able to get rid of it. Thankfully he has a low burden and is a healthy guy so its just getting through the treatment with patience and hope. While he loves to snuggle and chill, he also is a very excitable pup and definitely gets huge bursts of energy. 

Currently, we have a snuggle mat, multiple lucky mats, a few kongs, 4 different puzzle toys and a ball that he can roll to dispense kibble. Ive also used a towel to knot and give his food.

He has his crate where he sleeps during the night and sometimes i let him take naps in it, which is going well. However, I spend a lot of the time in my bed since the space is quite small, and I would just love to cuddle with my pup in bed& I was wondering if it would be a bad idea to let him lie with me in the bed during the day but let him sleep in his crate during the night? In my perspective, it would be part of his living area, but in the night back to the crate.

2023-10-26,1698353706,Taking in my sister's dog so he doesn't go to a shelter,"So my sister was trying to rehome her dog because she's moving. She was looking for months with no luck and i told her to let me take him before going to a shelter. We live in a liberal city with no kill shelters but they are always full and i cant risk him being put down or living in that stressful environment after living his whole life with my sister. 

Shes texted me that shes moving in less than 2 weeks and asked again if i would take him in. Right now my living situation is complicated. I live with my mom and shes currently trying to sell the house because its a risk for her to go up and down stairs (all bedrooms are on the 2nd story) They have been doing renovations for months now so ive been staying with my bf around 80% of the time.

When i told him i didnt know if i could take take care of her dog because A) ive never owned a dog ever even though i love them B) my mom never let me have one in her house (which i respect) C) im unemployed rn bc of mental health reasons but actively looking. He told me we can take her dog as he's fostered dogs before and his dog can do well with other dogs. I was so relieved and so was my sister.

Now i dont know what to do as a new dog owner. I think we may still try to find him a home bc my situation isn't stable and i want to be somewhere with enough room for both of us (me and the dog). Bf has a 1br apartment and i feel like i couldnt fully move in myself let alone with a dog but he said we'll make it work. But still i dont know the logistics of having a dog/rehoming.

So some of my questions are
-do i need to get his chip updated to my contact info?

-how do i handle him being in a new environment/ living with another dog?

-what are signs of stress to look out for and how can i comfort him?

-he wore a bark collar sometimes (im throwing it away) but what can i do to help him barking at any sound without it?

-he doesn't like people touching his legs so how do i groom/brush him without him freaking out? (He bit someone at the groomers once that i know of)

-how much does it cost to properly care for him? I know i need a job asap

-what are normal routines for a small dog with long hair? (Grooming, nails, baths, vet visits, vaccines) Should i just sync his schedule with my bf's dog? Do i transition from my sister's routine? (Ill ask her about all this too)

- hes a small dog but his harness is kinda snugg and kinda hard to put on with all his hair. Should i get a new one immediately?

-he doesnt really know how to play with other dogs or people but enjoys the company. He doesnt play fetch or tug of war. He plays with his toys and i try to play with him and get him excited which i think he likes but its different to how i play with my bf's dog. He does sit before a treat.

-do i get him a jacket for winter? Raincoat? I wanna spoil him but does he actually need it?

-how do i go about rehoming? Websites? How do i vet them? I really dont want something like this to happen again and want him to have a forever home.

I will be doing research but it kinda overwhelms me. I just want to feel prepared and give him the best home while hes with me even if its not forever. I'll also talk to my bf who has lots of experience but i dont want him to feel like I'm making it his problem. Im scared it wont be a good experience for the dog and i dont want him to be depressed bc hes not with my sister.

2023-10-26,1698347487,Resource Guarding: Positive Punishment and Positive Reinforcement,"My 11 month old puppy is usually very chill but he has resource gaurding tendencies. Usually he guards certain areas and he will agress upon our feet. 

Example: He gaurds the kitchen especially when cooking. Now, normally I would prevent this situation by crating him while I cook but sometimes he might still gaurd even when not cooking. He gaurds the area by snarling at our feet if we try to move. 

Our new trainer has us responding to the RG with Positive Punishment (Saying ""No"" in firm voice and aggressively shove him away using the shin) followed by Positive Reinforcement (Saying ""Good"" in happy voice followed by pets... assuming he stopped guarding).

Example: This morning I was working at my kitchen booth and he was underneath the booth chewing on the wood. RG was obviously imminent. I tried to lure him out but he wouldn't budge. It's dangerous for me to let him continue (staples in wood, etc.) so I lift up the booth and physically remove him and put him on a leash. I sit back down at the booth with him on the leash and he starts RG, snarling at my feet. I firmly said ""No"" and shoved him back with my shin (P+), not enough to hurt him but enough for him to go =3. He stopped RG and I immediately said ""Good"" in a nice voice and gave him pets (R+). I walked him into the living room and gave him love and attention and he calmed down and went back to normal. Since he started behaving well I took him back into the kitchen and hand fed him kibble (R+). I took off the leash and went back to the living room and he's been good for hours now. 

Now you might be thinking ""Why did you go back to the booth after you got him out? Why not go into the living room?"" (R-). And maybe you're right, maybe I should have done that. He would be removed from the stimulus but in my experience he would continue RG my feet in the living room. Besides I wanted to give the P+ a shot. 

I am curious what the community thinks of this approach. Personally my thoughts are that it makes sense. If he is actively snarling at our feet we can't do R-, what would we remove? The only option in my mind is P+ or do nothing. Maybe we could just sit there until he calms down then we can do R+ for the calm behavior? I think the P+ is balanced out by the immediate R+. We are encouraging good behavior while discouraging RG. Seems like it's being used effectively here.

2023-10-26,1698352814,What chews to give a picky dog?,"Junie, our almost 12 month old pup, needs some enrichment chews that she will actually like so that her owners can have a little peace and quiet :) She is a mix of a lot of things, and I dont know if its relevant, but she is mainly Lab (17%), Cattle dog (14%), Llewellyn Setter (13%), and everything else after is 10% or less according to Embark. Lots of energy and instincts! Please, if anyone has any suggestions, we need some ideas!! Im wary of giving her bones (we did try), antlers, or anything she could break a tooth on, but based on her chewing habits so far, I dont think she would bite hard enough to break teeth.
We have tried many types of chews (weve had her since she was ~3 mo.) and she has been hard to please. 
- Chews weve given and she wont touch: Himalayan chews, nylabone healthy edibles, yogurt sticks, soup bones, greenies, smart bones, beef tripe twists, collagen chews, west paw toys and other similarly built hard silicone/plastic toys.
- Chews that she liked but no longer wanted after the first, second or third: bully sticks, pigs ear, trachea tubes, beef tendon (she DESTROYED the trachea tubes and tendon when she got them the first time/few times. She acts like theyre gross now!), and we recently gave her a smoked bone which she tore off some of the dried stuff on the outside for a few minutes and then went to bury it in the couch. 
- Chews that she will chew/eat: Gullet sticks, no-hide chews (50/50), and chicken jerky, but these last only minutes if that. Sometimes she will go get the fish shaped benebone she picked out, she recently dug out the puppy dogwood and puppy wishbone that we bought when we first got her, every once in a while she will get out the root/wood chew, and she loved the ware dog gorilla wood chew from Hollywood Feed but we had to take it away because it was fraying a lot and I was nervous about it being too pointy.
- Non-chews that she loves to chew: She has torn apart (into small pieces) a Kong puppy goodie bone and puppy toothbrush shaped toy which were both made of a soft/squishy type of silicone(I think?), she will chew rope to break it, she chews small bits off of softer plastic toys (ears, horns, etc), and she LOVES destroying cardboard boxes.
When we give her new chews, she will usually sniff and lick it to decide if she wants it or not. If she hates it, she walks away from it. But, usually, if its interesting but she doesnt want to chew it, she will take it and bury it in the couch or blankets. Ill pull it back out and give it to her, and she will go and bury it in a different spot. 
Sometimes we will make lick mats and fill her kong and freeze them for her, but she is picky about what we use. She mainly likes wet dog food and cottage cheese, and will occasionally tolerate pumpkin, sweet potato, greek yogurt, and bone broth. She doesnt like peanut butter. As for fruits and veggies, she doesnt like anything weve given her except for green beans! 
I didnt want to give her a bone, but Im getting desperate. I was so excited when she was actually paying attention to it but was quickly disappointed when she went to bury it in the couch. She will sometimes chew on rope toys, soft/stuffed toys, and soft and bendable plastic toys. When she does chew these, she is chewing to rip or break them. I dont mind, we have a Barkbox subscription so she has more than enough toys and she has never actually fully ripped a toy apart. She just chews off any little bits that hang off like horns, tails, feet, and will rip out hard plastic eyes. We have puzzle toys too, but similar to the chews she does enjoy, they dont last long. And if we dont hold the board down she will just flip it to get the treats out lol! She likes the treat ball for her dry food sometimes but otherwise doesnt care much for it. 
So, what now? Is there an obvious chew that Im missing or is she just too picky and will have to stick with freezing things? Any and all suggestions are welcome!!!",dogs,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17h635l/what_chews_to_give_a_picky_dog/

We go on 4 or 5 walks a day and I give her lots of treats when she does poop outside during a walk (this usually happens only once a day.) Still, I haven't managed to make any progress.

I've tried giving her pineapple but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I'm keeping a close eye on her at all times to curb the habit and I know that Yorkies are famously hard to potty-train, but I'm wondering if anyone has any tips for me.

2023-10-26,1698287183,Looking for Breed Recommendations for a family dog,"My wife (39F) and I (37M) are looking for recommendations on breeds to consider for our family. We also have 2 boys (4 and 2) that would love for us to add to the family. Were considering getting one in the next year. We live in a large home on 1/3 an acre as well as have a Lakehouse wed take them to during summers as well.

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

As adults/family, this would be our first. When I was a child my parents were AKC registered Chihuahua breeders. My wife grew up with golden retrievers.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Ideally a reputable breeder.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

One that is affectionate and playful but also does not require constant attention. Loves to go for walks or go out to the yard solo, happy to play with the humans but also ok with the occasional relaxing time on the couch.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

My wife and I were originally leaning towards a doodle mix because of the minimal allergies and have heard great things about them being great family dogs.

My cousin who is a trainer recommended we look into Lagottos for the same reasons but also because she has negative feelings about Goldendoodles.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Not looking to train for sport but mainly obedience and typical kid friendly things.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We can devote up to a couple of hours each day directly to the dog.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

Happy to take them to a dog park or allow them free roam of the yard. Walks are also clearly an option. Dog daycare is also a fun idea.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Happy to do what I can but very open to paying a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium sized dog ideally. Wife is very against small dogs (like Chihuahuas).

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Handle, or prefer? Prefer minimal across all 3. But Id prioritize minimal shedding then barking then slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Pretty important but definitely happy to get an invisible fence installed too

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

More snuggly than not.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Closer to eager to please than not.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Mostly friendly unless a threat is directly identified.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Yes but not ideal.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

None come to mind

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not that often. My wife and I work from home most days.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I believe this has been identified in previous answers already but open to answering additional questions.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Definitely 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Chicago suburbs. No bans.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

75 in summer, 30 in winters

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We do have a larger home. Also very much so would want to take the dog for obedience training. My wife does have allergies so less than average shedding / allergens are definitely required.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

However he continues to sleep through the night without wanting to go potty. 

He has visited the vets and been given a clean bill of health, which leads me to believe this is a behavioural issue. He has a daily routine and adequate play, walking and nap times. No other behavioural issues. He's playful, affectionate, social, and not territorial of anyone or anything.

He will pee up the side of his crate, his soft bed, the legs of sofas, most doors when open, curtains, a friends coat hanging and touching the floor once, slippers, all rug corners, and pretty much anything else he fancies. Even when directly in front of me. The only safe place for him is on my bed or on the sofas. 

I always scrub clean with water clean further with an enzymatic cleaner, he always pees on it again. 

So far I've tried with no success: restricting access to areas, using pee mats, taking him outside more often (will come inside and instantly pee up something), a play pen (he'll pee anywhere in it), fake grass mats, clapping loudly or moving him as he lifts his leg to pee.

**Context**: Our care dog from Ukraine ran into some health issues lately. She's 7 years old now and up to this point had not been neutered. When her period began, there was nothing out of the ordinary, but it continued for a lot longer than usual and the amount of blood that we found on the floor exceeded the usual amount on a day when we also noticed that she was sensitive to the touch. My girlfriend was hugging her and the dog started screaming like a pig on the skewer. Soon thereafter, whilst we were trying to find a vet that was still open in the evening, she began standing upright and couldn't settle down any more. When we finally found a doctor, we brought her to a car - which became a bit of an operation as we couldn't lift her up due to her pain. We used a bedsheet to raise her slowly and steadily.

Either way, it turned out that she had a Pyometra (a serious and potentially life-threatening infection of the uterus that causes it to fill with bacteria and pus). The vet gave her an infusion and antibiotics and told us to wait for her to stabilise again and eventually remove the uterus in an operation.

This turned out to be a mistake, as she bounced back to better health for 12 days, and then her health deteriorated again. We took her to another clinic, where they informed us that the other vet should have intervened straight away, instead of 'waiting it out'. They operated on her and successfully removed the uterus and then discharged her the next evening.

At this point, she hadn't really eaten for 34 days and at the clinic this was one of the main reasons they sent her back to us, as she's very primed to a select few people and refused to eat there too. They gave us Mirtazepin (increases appetite + anti-depressant) for the dog.

And yet, she didn't really start eating by herself again. Since she had lost quite a few kilograms (I believe it was 19  16) we started giving her treats - most of which she turned down, but some she ate. We thought that something is better than nothing. Then we started feeding her high calory dog feed (from the clinic) at her place and out of our hands, as she wouldn't get up to eat.

She was discharged from the clinic on Saturday, and now it's Thursday, but she still refuses to eat from the bowl. This is not ideal, obviously. We already started phasing out much of the medication (Kesium, Mirtazepin, Novalgin, Dia Tab) as per the treatment plan.

Do you have tips on how to 'reset' this behaviour? Novalgin (painkiller) can supposedly lead to loss of appetite, but we've been gradually reducing her dosage for a few days already, and today we didn't give her any so that there already should've been a change in behaviour if it was connected to this.

Perhaps this is just normal following an operation, but we are worried, as she has lost a lot of weight and didn't really take in much other than what we managed to feed her.

We'll be at the vet again tonight and enquire about this - perhaps someone was in a similar situation though? ;)

2023-10-26,1698327377,I lost my beautiful dog suddenly.,"I know many of you have been through the same grief. I've been reading a lot about it to see if it helps a little bit, but I can't calm down yet. It came out of nowhere, even though she was 14 years old. Maybe if I write it down, I will be relieved and I can help others what to pay attention to.  
  
My dog had a sudden belly pain two weeks ago, right before her dinner. I couldn't touch her without whining, she was just panting painfully and staring the floor. We immediately thought of panreatitis, she was already cured of it once many years ago, so we rushed to the emergency clinic, since it was already night. After the ultrasound they told us she had blood in her belly, and this is caused by a rutpured tumor usually. They said there was a chance that the tumor was on her spleen, so in order to save her life an emergency surgery was required. They mentioned that she had lost a lot of blood already, and if the tumor was elsewhere, they probably couldn't save her, so they mentioned the choice that they could put her down immediately. We were in totally shock - tumor? We were at the vet 3! days before this, she had blood test few months ago, and ultrasound often, and everything was fine. She was given plenty of vitamins and the best quality food because of her strict diet since her pancreatitis. She always had problems with her liver, pancreas and spleen, and she was coughing because her heart was already weaker, but all of these were under control, we thought. With these hopes and thoughts we immediately decided on surgery. We said goodbye to her and she was taken away, in fear and pain.  
  
Unfortunately it turned out soon that the mass was on her liver. There was also a lot of clotted blood in her abdomen, she might have been bleeding for hours, days. They said and wrote later that her liver structure 'collapsed', and it had several hemorrhages on its surface. It was also enlarged along with her spleen. They said there was nothing they could do to save her. She fell asleep forever.  
  
I haven't recovered since then. They said it was cancer and was totally inoperable, but it's like I can't hear it, can't believe it, I just read and read what could it be. I have found 'hemangiosarcoma', but she was a little white angel, not a typical cancer of this breed. I feel like I'm going crazy with the uncertainty, even though it doesn't help her anymore. I feel guilty that I couldn't save her but that's not what I promised. What if it wasn't cancerous at all? I know the diagnosis seems bad but what if... I am blaming myself what I could have done differently. I can see her scared look in front of me as if she didn't want to die. She looked massive and strong until the last minutes. I am asking myself, maybe they could have save her? I am consumed by the pain and past, meanwhile I'm also afraid of the future without her. At least I would have known in advance that there was a problem, and I could have save her from dying in shock and unbearable pain.  
  
Maybe one day I'll accept that it was the best choice for her in that situation, but now it just hurts so bad and missing her so much that I can't bear it.

I tried my best to run behind the car to stop him/her but didn't made it. Then i took this cutie and watched her to be sure she was all right and i noticed her big belly and immediatly understood that she was pregnant. I took her home with me, gave her food and water and then drove to the nearest vet. During this time she was crying in pain and sadness because she understood that the ""owner"" wasn't coming back to take her and a leg was broken. 

In fact when i took her to the vet he noticed that her leg was having something wrong and medicated it. He made a full control of the cutie and said that she was fine but very soon he should gave birth to some puppies.

So right now i'm with her and i'm taking good care of her but i don't know what to do. Should i take this angel for me??? I mean she is very sweet and lovely but really i don't know if i shall take her or put her in a shelter=,.

I am just a little worried about the meet and greet with our current dog, but not for the reasons you might think. Our current dog, Gertie (5yo, german shep/husky mix, 50lbs), is incredibly friendly and social, probably a bit too much. She gets very excited when meeting new people or creatures, often to the point where they (especially creatures) get overwhelmed by her. It is worth mentioning, almost every dog she has interacted with in her life is older than her, so maybe it has just been a factor of not matching her energy. However, she has never been great at picking up signals, even when those signals are full on growls and snaps. The only time she has spent with a puppy was shortly after we adopted her and had to board her for a couple days. The boarders mentioned they put her with a puppy and the puppy ended up hiding in the corner. She was only about a year old at that point and has definitely calmed since, but not enough that I think she won't get a bit overbearing with the new puppy. I intend to do a bit of a slow intro once the new puppy is in the house (keeping them in separate rooms, but slowly adding sight then touch so they can get used to each other). My only concern is that when we meet the puppy so the shelter can make sure we are a good fit, that she will scare the puppy and then they won't let us have her. 

  
Does anyone know of some things I should do during the interaction (ie, keep her leash tight vs loose, have treats, admonish her when she is being too much)?

2023-10-25,1698214557,My best friend's dog won't stop peeing in my apartment,"Hey Yall

I have had a best friend for several years. I think she's a wonderful person and have no ill will against her. We both have dogs who get along great. It works out because we have a working relationship of being each other's dog sitter.

A couple years ago I moved into a new apartment, and her dog has started peeing on my couch whenever I watch her. This has not been a problem before this apartment. Right now I'm watching her again. I've had her dog for a little over a week now, and she's peed on the couch 35-40 times. I'd guess it's been 150-200 times or so since I started living here. Luckily I have a futon and can clean the cover, but the cushion is absolutely ruined. I have pee pads on the floor, and (only as of this past week) I have a washable pee cover on the couch that my friend bought (to put a bandaid on the issue rather than addressing it head on at home). My apartment stinks and it's affecting my own dog because she can't hang out where she usually does.

I can't lie, I'm starting to have very strong negative feelings towards this dog. Today, she peed on something very valuable to me, and at this point I just don't think I can watch her any more. My friend refuses to do the hard work of training her dog at home, or even crate training her. Her apartment literally smells like dog pee everywhere. I am at my wits end. I need to tell my friend how I feel, but I also don't want to ruin our friendship or sabotage the chances of her watching my dog in the future. For the record, my dog is well behaved and does not pee on anything.

Both of our dogs are old, maybe 15-16 in age, but I've watched her dog pee enough times to make a relatively educated judgement that it is purposeful and not accidental. She pees wherever she sees my dog hanging out. She clearly controls it by location (following my dog around to mark territory) and makes sure no body is looking.

I've tried crate training her myself but she legitimately goes psychotic in the crate (and I often times have to clean up things that make me gag and come very close to vomiting). 

Sorry for the rant, Any advice? I love all dogs, but I can't help but really disliking her dog. I'm trying to not blame the dog but I'm frustrated. I know my friend has TRAINED her dog to pee on pee pads at home, which has trickled into her couch and bed, and often times she doesn't even walk her in the morning when she goes to work. I'm not so sure she walks her enough times during the day at all and maybe has been lying about it. I'm going to go insane.

Also worth noting is I have told the vet several times I was feeding her this and they didn't say anything. I guess I was misinformed! I think I will switch her to Iams. Thank you so much yall!

Hello fellow dog owners! I'm looking for some advice on what is the best formula to feed my dog. I've been feeding her the puppy formula since I found her at 6 weeks old. She loves it. She is now a year and it's time to switch her to adult dog food.

2023-10-25,1698255853,Recommendations for Dog Breeds,"Hello everyone! I have been going back and forth on what dog breeds would be good to own for the future. I want to eventually (as in 2-3 years from now) get a dog that I can take out with me and feel safe with walking around as a small female. I need a dog that has some size to it and has that ""look"" to it that encourages people to stay away, but also a realistic breed that I can work with as a small woman. I would like to get this dog professionally trained in obedience to take with me to a lot of places, and one that is calm and confident in themselves. By calm I do not mean lazy or super low energy, as I would also love a dog that I could go to sport training classes with once a week (like dock diving).  I also own a cat, and absolutely need a dog that can get along with other animals. Here below is the filled out questionnaire, and I would really appreciate any recommendations or feedback!

\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\*   
  
\* A lot of different breeds, including the Doberman, GSD, Rottweiler, etc.  
  
\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\*   
  
\* Not quite a ""protection dog"" as in trained in that line of work, but a dog that serves as a deterrent by their confident and calm demeanor and looks. A dog that can be trained in obedience and is known to be reliable and not overly aggressive to people and pets.   
  
\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?  
  
\* I have owned a pitbull previously, and she was a great dog, but she did not have that calm confident energy that I am looking for. She was more of a fun wrecking ball and not a lot of natural focus. I trained her with basic commands. For this future dog I would like to get professional obedience training.  
  
\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?   
  
\* Absolutely! I 100% need a dog that can learn to live with other dogs and cats. I plan on living with other dogs and cats for the rest of my life, and I need a dog who doesn't automatically want to kill other animals.  
  
\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*   
  
\* No children, and I don't imagine I will have children visiting.   
  
\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?  
  
\* By the time I get this dog I will own my house and have a fenced in yard, which is why I am going to wait 2-3 years.   
  
\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  
  
\* I have a boyfriend who likes dogs, but is a bit nervous around animals in general. While this dog will be my personal pet, he might occasionally have to walk them- so, again, that confident calmness would be crucial.   
  
\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*  
  
\* Rarely, however, I don't want a breed that is so suspicious of people naturally that it would lunge out and attack the first person it sees in its territory.  
  
\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*   
  
\* I prefer a rescue but am also realistic about my expectations. I am okay with getting a puppy from a reputable breeder.  
  
\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   
  
\* Either a puppy or young adult, as they will be easier to teach (especially to not chase my cat) and I want to put a lot of training and time into my dog.   
  
\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)  
  
\* Looking for a dog 50-150 pounds.   
  
\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   
  
\* I do not want a yappy dog. A little barking is fine, but I do not want a LGD.  
  
\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  
  
\* A lot. I do prefer the looks of a long-haired breed, and I find brushing pets to be really soothing and relaxing. Also willing to research proper grooming techniques and invest in professional tools.   
  
\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.  
  
\* Any amount of shedding is fine.  
  
\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*   
  
\* Yes to both.  
  
\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*   
  
\* I strongly prefer less slobber, which is part of the reason that I am more hesitant on a rottweiler. I don't care about farts.  
  
\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*   
  
\* Pretty easy to please, as I want to do extensive training with them and occasional sports. Being a small female, if I am getting a large breed of dog I need them to want to listen.  
  
\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*   
  
\* Obedience and some sport.  
  
\*\*Is there any behavior you cant accommodate?\*\*   
  
\* Aggression towards other animals for sure. I want to be able to trust my dog around cats, other dogs, and maybe even chickens (as in the chickens are in a coop, and I can trust my dog not to try to break in to kill them).  
  
\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   
  
\* Very important.  
  
\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   
  
\* Can exercise my dog for an hour on the weekdays (would like to do bike rides with them and walks) and would like to do dog sports on the weekend (maybe dock diving, frisbee, or agility).  
  
\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   
  
\* 30 minutes each day, not counting exercise time.  
  
\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*   
  
\* In the house in a crate (after crate training) when left alone, and sleeping on a dog bed besides the people bed on the floor.  
  
\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*   
  
\* About 6-7 hours on the weekdays.  
  
\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*   
  
\* Yes, especially if they are a puppy!  
  
\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume youre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).  
  
\* East coast US  
  
\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?\*\* Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.  
  
\* Planning on moving up north of where I am now, so this is a hard question to answer. Probably 85 in summer and 50 in winter.  
  
\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\*  
  
\* 10, when I am ready to get that dog in 2-3 years.  
  
\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*   
  
\* Yes.",dogs,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17gajki/recommendations_for_dog_breeds/
2023-10-25,1698254413,Choosing a good apartment dog,"Hey all, we're looking to get a dog! I'd really appreciate your help on choosing a breed.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Introduction\*\*

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

**\* No. Have owned two dogs in childhood.**

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]

**\* Would prefer a reputable breeder.**

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

**Loving, affectionate, calm, small, doesn't need lots of exercise, and doesn't bark too much (or can be trained not to bark too much). Health is also important, so we'd prefer not to get breeds that have known health issues (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a great example of a dog we love, but has known genetic health issues).**

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

**Japanese Chin** \- loving, affectionate, calm, and doesn't bark too much. Only issue is shedding.Toy **Poodle** \- Similar to above. Biggest concern is that I've read that they bark a lot, and are very high energy.

**Cavalier King Charles Spaniel -** This was eventually ruled out because of their known health issues. But this is a really beautiful breed that has most of the traits that we really want in a dog. It's just the health issues that seem unworkable.

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

**Training it not to bark too much is important. I know that dogs bark, but I just would hate to have my neighbors endure hours of barking.**

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

**No**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

**Probably 45-120 minutes a day. That would include a walk, feeding it, and playing with it.**

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**Probably an hour max. More realistically, 30 minutes. Maybe a bit longer on weekends.**

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

**Open to brushing a few times a week. Not as open to the other stuff.**

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

**Very small. Toy sized ideally**

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

**Obviously, the less the better. But I also understand that it's a reality of owning a dog.**

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

**Not important**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

**Snuggly**

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

**Probably a combination, but slightly more leaning towards eager to please.**

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

**Ideally calmly, without barking, but I know that barking is a reality of owning a dog so it isn't a deal breaker if they bark in this particular context.**

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

**Would prefer not to, but will do what I have to.**

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

**I can't deal with excessive barking. An occasional bark here and there is fine (like if someone rings the doorbell or comes onto the property). But I have neighbors that I want to be fair to.**

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

**We work from home, so we can tend to the dog pretty often. Between the hours of 9-5 our availability will be far more limited, but we can take little breaks to do things that the dog needs.**

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

**The dog should not bark excessively. It's okay if it barks when the doorbell rings or if someone comes close to the house (that is acceptable but not ideal). But it can't be barking for several minutes at a time at nothing.**

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

**No**

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\*\*No, but we may have children in the near future.\*\*22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

**Yes. The dog must be small.**

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

**Not applicable.**

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

**75-80 degrees fahrenheit (27 C) in summer, 55 degrees in winter (13-14 C)**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

**The dog must not have genetic health defects. Of course, any breed has its issues with health. But there are some breeds that have known genetic health defects that we want to avoid. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one example of this. Would be great if the dog is hypoallergenic, but this is not a deal breaker.**

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-10-25,1698249361,best trucks for large breed dogs?,"Im not in a hurry to get a car, just looking for ideas.

He loves every dog he meets, but I know he can be a lot at first. He plays very well with my in laws lab.

Especially if their parents were genetically tested, or came from linage with desirable traits? 

The biggest issue with designer dogs, is that they are not bred ethically. Parents aren't tested, the mothers and pups are often living in shitty living conditions, the ""breeders"" aren't ""breeders"", they're generally just doing it for a quick buck without adequate training, etc. Don't get me started on backyard breeders. If governments were to properly legistate conditions for which cross-breeders needed to meet before they bred dogs, would designer dogs become more acceptable?

2023-10-25,1698232102,Crate trained dog barking in crate at night,"Hi there! Im hoping to get some insight, as Im a new dog mama! 

TLDR; our sweet crate trained rescue is suddenly barking in crate at night after 6 weeks with us, with no issues before. Any suggestions on how to address this? 



My family rescued a 2-3 year old golden retriever about 6 weeks ago. Shes just an absolute sweetheart. 

We were informed by the rescue that she was not only crate trained, but that she loved her crate. This didnt matter to us one way or the other, but since her foster told us she loved a crate, we got her one and have been using one since we got her 6 weeks ago. She goes in without issue when we leave the house for a bit (1-3 hours max a few times a week), and at bedtime she goes in her crate without us even telling her to after her pre-bedtime potty time. 


Her crate is in the kitchen, where we leave the door open all day as long when were home. She goes in there willingly when were in the kitchen,  but not obsessively to the point where it seems like anxiety needing to be near us. She lies in her crate during our mealtimes most of the time (sometimes at our feet lying under the table), and will go in there when were doing dishes, sitting at the table working, etc. Sometimes she lies on her bed or on the couch in the living room while well in the kitchen too, so if doesnt seem like a separation anxiety thing. 

When Im actively cooking or when we have just sat down to eat, I sometimes redirect her into her crate to reinforce it so she doesnt get caught under my feet when cooking/to discourage begging.



This week, 1 night she didnt pee before bed - we opened the door and walked outside but she looked at us with tired eyes and went to her crate, as if to say I am too tired to potty


Early that morning, we heard her whining, whcuh after a couple minutes turned to barking,  so we thought maybe she needed to potty, so we let her out of her crate and she ran to the door and peed outside. After, she went back into her crate and we all went back to sleep. 


Now we wait outside with her till she pees first before bed, and we give her a few kibbles after. Several nights passed without incident so we thought it was a one off. 


This evening, she woke us up barking at 1am, and again at 3am. The first time she went to the living room and seemed like she wanted to play, but went pee outside when prompted. At 3am, she didnt need to potty, was just barking. 

My husband ended up sleeping on the couch at this point because

 1. We dont know if were supposed to let her bark it out 


2. We have a toddler who will wake up if she barks too long (has woken up from a nap when someone is at the door and our pup barks)


We assume letting her out and sleeping on the couch this evening was probably reinforcing the behavior,  but we want to know how to approach this so we dont cause her stress. 

Also, we would not mind her sleeping in our room, but we have a cat and theyre not acclimated to each other yet, and our room is his safe spot right now. 

We also dont NEED to crate her at night per se, but since shes new to us and cant sleep in our room yet, we prefer her in her crate when unsupervised at night. 

Also, we cover the crate with a sheet and have a fan on for white noise. And a comfy bed inside it too. And we measured her to verify its the right size.

Lastly, we have a trainer weve been working with and we plan to discuss it with her as well, but wanted to see various input.

2023-10-25,1698208327,[Breeds] Struggling to choose the right hypoallergenic dog. Experienced dog owners with allergies,"\*\*Hi! I'm new to reddit and this is my very first post. I am a 40F, married to a 35M and we have a 2.5 y.o. daughter. We have a dog we love and would like another. We live in a home on 1/4 acre and a very walkable neighborhood. My husband is allergic and so we need a hypoallergenic dog. My husband has been taking antihistamines for a decade for the love of this dog, and we need a path to not take the meds. He is seeking the immunology shots currently. In the meantime, we would love input about which breed to get that would be allergy friendly!\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* I had 3 dogs growing up. I was the primary caretaker for all. My husband and I adopted an akita/husky mix in 2014. He is 90 lbs and so calm and gentle. We were diligent about his training (Love that dog training program), and it paid off.   
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* We are open to both rescue or a breeder. However, we are willing to go to a breeder to get what we want. If a rescue, we need to verify the breed somehow for the allergy needs.   
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* friendly, while also providing some security. Good with other dogs or other animals. Sociable with people and children. Trainable, obedient, less than average amount of barking. hypoallergenic. Affectionate. Medium sized, less than 45 pounds. Not too small, larger than 15 pounds.   
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* We think we want a doodle, because we perceive them to fit the qualities listed above. Our experience with these doodle breeds is limited. We also considered a yorkie, a poodle, a schnauzer. My husband and I grew up with golden retrievers, labs, border collies, huskies. Not much in depth experience with other breeds. I  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* sit, stay, come, back up, leave it. Give a handshake, fetch and return. To be excellent at recall. a bonus if we can do some tricks but not necessary. Would love a dog who loves to hike.

\* average is 1 hour, but on the weekends 2+ hours with hiking  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I can reasonably brush 2x per week at a minimum. I already brush our current dog 2x a week. I am not confident about trimming hair, but would be willing to pay the groomer  
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
\* &gt;15-40&lt;  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* low tolerance for shedding. low tolerance for barking (our current dog is relatively quiet). Indifferent about slobber,I  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* Our current dog has moderate recall skills (better when he was younger), we would prefer to have stronger recall so that we could do more off leash.   
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* We will not allow the dog on the furniture, but we are happy to do some cuddling on the floor. Our current dog is a love bug. I  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

High priority (no compromise):

Size

Kid friendly

Willing to be very active but also able to chill at home

Other priorities that could perhaps be compromised

Strongly prefer an intelligent breed that is eager to please (i.e. pastoral or hunting breeds)

Prefer less shedding

Prefer less grooming

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I have owned multiple dogs all my life. I have a very strong preference for the eager to please-ness and handler focus of a pastoral or gun dog. Ive had other dogs and they just dont fit with my personality. Of course I am open to compromise, since finding the very perfect breed for my situation doesnt seem possible. (hence why Im here asking!)

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Breeder

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Border collie without the intense need for constant stimulation at home. Or a Golden Retriever in a smaller package. Basically a smart dog, eager to please, up for a run, hike, beach trip, fetch, games, training, long walks, etc. but not in need of CONSTANT mental stimulation and attention at home (note: we will of course train and play and stimulate them at home. I just mean we also want to be able to watch TV in the evening or have a lazy Sunday afternoon without the dog looking to us for mental stimulation every waking hour).

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\- Border Collie (ruled out because needs too much attention constantly).

\- Brittany (Same problem as above)

\- Mini poodles and smooth collies (both not bred here in my EU country, and collies are a bit too big anyway. Standard poodles too big, toys too small

)

\- Toller (I could maybe find one from another country and pay a lot to get it here, but I suspect they fall into the same category as the BC and Brittany?)

\- Cant get springer spaniels here

\- English cocker spaniels are common and seem to fit the bill... Are they more calm at home than BCs and Brittanys? 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* Be active but able to switch off at home. Be handler focused. Play fetch.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* No

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* Not including physical exercise outside the house? We work from home so would be able to interact in short sessions off and on all day and would almost always be there for companionship. But obviously we do actually need to work 8 hours each, so the dog needs to be able to settle while with us.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

1-2 hours a day. Im a runner, hiker, cycler, outdoors kind of person. We have dog parks nearby I would probably use at weekends. Also longer hikes/walks/trips at weekends.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Its not something I want (who does?) but Im more willing to compromise on this than other factors. If its perfect in every other way, I can handle regular grooming and/or regular visits to a pro. Groomer.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

No bigger than 20kg (45lbs)! Ideally would be in the 10-15kg (20-35lbs) range. We could go a bit smaller but with 2 young kids that would start getting to a size where its less ideal for the dog.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

As little as possible but again, something that can be compromised on if necessary.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not essential but I would really really like to be able to do this

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Greet friendly

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Few hours here and there. Mostly people will be at home.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Same as mine

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

N/A

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* We wont be competing. I want to train my dog in general as a hobby. There is a brukshundklubb, like working dog club thing next to where I live where I would like to take courses and train, maybe twice a week. Rest of training will be in the yard or in our forrest.  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* I want them to be part of my life most of the day. I currently walk about 2.5h per day during weekdays (1.5 hour in the morning and 1h in the evening). I want a companion for those longer walks, but also looking forward to more shorter walks throughout the day. On top of that, I would spend one or two evenings at the dog training club doing courses, and I would probably spent some hours here and there throughout the week doing training. I hope my kids would also like to do some training. We have plenty of fields and we live net to the woods, and our family spend a lot of time outdoors.   
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* No running, but I walk about 2 to 2.5h per day. That would be the bulk of the exercise. Maybe my fiancée could take the dog for runs as well, but that woud be sporadic. Walks, long and short, would be the bulk of it.   
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* Id prefer net too much grooming. But its not a deal-breaker. I would of course do what would be needed.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* Medium to large dog.  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* Id prefer less, for all of those things, but I can handle it. Not dealbreaker.  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* It would be important for me. When I am out in the forrest, I want to have been training my dog to a level where we can comfortably hike without a leash without having to worry about the dog going totally crazy if we run into deer or similar.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* I would love a snuggly dog.   
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\* Eager to please would be good. But also not a deal breaker.   
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* Here I am not sure. I sleep lightly, because sometimes I am worried. Sometimes I need to sleep alone in the house. I want the dog to a least wake up and warn me if there is something going on. But, at the same time I would like the dog, when I am with it, to be able to greet strangers. I guess I am looking for something in the middle.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* No.  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\* Nothing that I can think of.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* Not long. I cannot think of situations where it would be left alone. Some minutes here and there.  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* My wife, and my two sons would be involved with the dog somewhat. Maybe take it for walks and do some playing with it. But I would be the one spending most of the time with the dog (during the days etc.)  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* No other pets, no other pets planned.  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* Yes. By sons are currently 4 and 6.  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\* No.  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
\* I live in Sweden, out of the big cities.   
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
\* Winters are cold, and summers are usually pretty hot. Temperate environment.  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
\* I would of course prefer a dog that doesnt have known health issues. Dog will of course have proper insurance etc.

2023-10-31,1698743834,Letting go of my best friend and soulmate,"We put our family dog down yesterday and it feels like Ive lost a part of myself and my soul. I loved her like Ive loved nothing before and it feels like Ive failed her. We went to the vet yesterday since shes been on antibiotics due to a pneumonia, sadly she had gotten another infection in her uterus. Our vet told us that our beloved family member was fighting right now and that she hadnt fully recovered but sounded a bit better (she was breathing fast and heavily). For the last couple of days she stopped eating, couldnt sleep so she sat up, mostly being exhausted, trouble going to the toilet and wasnt herself. It was hard seeing her that way. Sometimes she would be more herself by barking and wanting cuddles. Our vet said we could undergo a procedure to remove her infected uterus but wasnt sure she would make it due to her pneumonia. We didnt really know what to do. She was 10 years old and the thought about her undergoing this operation and not making it felt horrible, we didnt want her last hours being scared, alone and with her fighting to recover and staying alive. She would need intensive care. When she went to sleep my father held her closely and petted her, I couldnt be in the room which I also feel awful about.

We decided to let her go. Now I cant get over the thought that maybe she couldve made it if we just gave her a chance. I dont know what to do with all this guilt. Everything happened so quickly and it feels unreal, it feels like we gave up too fast and failing her by letting her go. I have so much guilt over not giving her more in life, of not doing more for her when she was healthy. I havent lived at home for about two years but I constantly think about why I didnt go and see her more, why I didnt take her on long walks, why I didnt take her to see the world more. What can I do to cope with this guilt?",dogs,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17kgv1p/letting_go_of_my_best_friend_and_soulmate/

2023-10-31,1698710880,My girl took the rainbow bridge today &amp; im devastated.,"Our girl was 5 years old, turning 6 in February &amp; was diagnosed with Lymphoma in August. Being as we just had a daughter 9 months ago &amp; couldnt afford chemo, we opted for the prednisone route to keep her as comfortable as possible for as long as possible. She started to decline the last couple of weeks, so we took her in on Thurs &amp; the vet said she wouldnt chance going thru the weekend, in case things took a serious decline. But we upped her preds &amp; took the chance &amp; scheduled her euthanasia for this afternoon. 

Over the weekend we did all her favorite things. Went for as many walks as possible, played fetch, played in the leaves, watched the ducks &amp; all the treats. Then my wife &amp; I took today off to spend all morning with her, just us, as we dropped our daughter off at daycare. It was the best day. We went for a morning walk to the park, played fetch &amp; she had some cheeseburgers &amp; an ice cream cone for lunch. Then headed for the vet. 

Watching our girl get ripped away from us was truly heartbreaking. Nothing could have prepared me for that. I havent been able to stop crying since we got home, Im absolutely devastated. 

I guess the point of my post is just to vent &amp; also ask how some of you have coped losing a dog so young? She was a mixed breed &amp; was never sick a day in her life. We thought she was going to live forever (not literally but at least 10-12 yrs). I feel robbed of time with her. Im so sad that my daughter wont grow up with her as her puppy. Shes been with me &amp; my wife thru everything. Graduating college, moving across country, getting married, moving back, buying a house &amp; now the start of parenthood.

Honestly, stay away from any site that provides dogs via website. If you don't meet this dog in person before hand, do NOT purchase a dog. This breeder was fully ready to just drop the incorrect puppy on my doorstep and take their money and go.

I did my research, and i did not notice any usual signs of stress, his tail is not down, and his fur does not seem to be up. He also never actually bites, he puts teeth on skin like if he were to bite, but never presses, he also pounces. He seems to ´´laugh´´ while doing so, but i know that does not mean anything at all.

During the playtime i try to ´´grab him´´ or ´´pounce him´´ (very lightly ofc, and really just pretend). And he does the same back. He does not mind taking treats right after the play from my hand, even asks for them.  


All of that seems like a play to me, but i dont want to risk stressing my dog, or make him feel actually threatened. Iam mostly concerned that its ´´growl´´ near him that triggers this ´´playful´´ behavior, it makes me scared that i make him feel threatened.

* No, I have a 10 month old mini schnauzer. Hes got basic obedience down and I use r+ training methods. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Responsible breeder. Unfortunately, I got my current dog from a byb and know how to prevent that in the future.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* a small and sturdy dog. Someone to go on hikes with, long walks, play kinda rough with and very eager to please. Im getting into dog sports like agility and nosework, so a dog that likes to try new things and has a lot of confidence.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Almost any terrier (minus APBT/Staffies). Im not opposed to another mini schnauzer, but wondering if theres anything else thats a tad less prone to reactivity but still has the drive, playfulness, friendliness and energy level as my mini. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Hopefully the CGC skills, tricks, basic obedience

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* agility and nosework, which Im taking lessons for now, but Id also like to try rally (no experience)

* Small-medium (no smaller than a min schnauz and no bigger than, say, an Airedale)

2023-10-30,1698698367,"UPDATE (and good news): My dog passed away, first time loss, I have some questions.","Several months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/s/JGJo9uJyag) asking for guidance after my dog passed away. You all were absolutely wonderful and so helpful. 

One user (whose name I'm trying to find, will edit when I do) made us a beautiful portrait of my dog. I had it made into some magnets for my fridge. When we moved shortly after he passed, his face was one of the first things I saw in our new home. It helped immensely. 

Many people had stories to share, advice, and things to be aware of. It helped me so much to read these and know what kinds of feelings I might have over time. 

Well, after about 5 months, my partner and I have adopted a new dog. He is a lab mix, two years old, and very affectionate. He shares some things in common with my last dog - for example, he also doesn't mess with our stuff, and he is also incredibly empathetic. He's also different in a lot of ways - he cuddles more and has a bit more energy, but not too much for us to handle. 

A dog-shaped hole in my heart has been filled, and though this new dog has not replaced my old one, he's occupied that void that was left after May. 

Some of the advice I was given, I even look back on now - how it's okay and normal to feel guilty when you learn something new that you wish you'd known for your previous dog(s), and how it feels this new one was sent my by old dog. We're doing very well, and loving life with our new friend. Thank you all SO MUCH for your support. Know that it was much appreciated.",dogs,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17k33ee/update_and_good_news_my_dog_passed_away_first/
2023-10-30,1698682697,"Advice for Breeds for Mediterranean climate, (kinda) first time owners","\*\*Introduction\*\*  
**1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
\* Yes/no. My partner has had a dog for most of his childhood/teenage years and he took care of taking her out for walks for most of those years. So no direct experience being the sole owner, but a realistic expectation of what is required especially in terms of time.

  
**2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?**  
\* We'd rather start with a puppy, so we'd prefer going through a breeder.

  
**3)	Describe your ideal dog.**  
\* Healthy, friendly, intelligent, cuddly, roughly in priority order. Short hair, both because of shedding and the hot climate of southern Italy where we'll live. Medium size with the exception of lanky breeds like the greyhound which we're quite interested in!

  
**4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
\* These are mostly aesthetic preferences because while we've googled them a bit, we haven't found definite character assessments, but: greyhounds, we just like the look and feel they'd be well suited to the climate. We like what we've heard about border collies in terms of intelligence, but we feel they're too long-haired. Then some assorted breeds we haven't researched but like the look of and the little we've heard about their temperament as well: labrador and pointers.

  
**5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
\* Being well-heeled would be top of the list for me. Getting to the point where I can trust them off the leash in the right situations (hikes, etc) and trusting them not to strain at the leash constantly when they're on it. Also, keeping the barking in check insofar as it's possible.

  
**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
\* Nope!  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  **7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
\* Both me and my partner work from home, it'll be a fairly large house on two floors. So we are going to spend a lot of time with them, and we're looking forward to dedicating a lot of that to training and playing. I'd say comfortably a couple of hours of intense interaction daily and more casual playing throughout the day.

  
**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**    
\* Apart from playing daily in the house and the garden as per the above, and weekends outside/park/hiking weather permitting, probably only two daily walks around the neighbourhood. Impossible to quantify right now as we don't live there yet, but we'll make them as long as recommended/necessary.

  
**9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
\* For ill or luck we'll live literally next door to a pet groomer's shop, so there's that. We'd still like a dog that doesn't require a lot of brushing, but we'll have the time and the disposition to do most of it at home!  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
**10)	What size dog are you looking for?**  
\* Medium, but I'm not sure where some breeds fall. One breed that I consider large that I'd like is the Greyhound.

  
**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
\* Shedding and barking are what I'd like to limit as much as possible.

  
**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
\* Important for me, even if it takes a long time to get there.  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
\* Snuggly!

  
**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**  
\* The latter, we'd love a loyal dog that sticks to us, outside and inside.

  
**15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**    
\* Ideally in fantasy land a dog that loses its crap at intruders and can differentiate between guests and intruders. That having been said, more realistically, if we had to choose we'd go with friendly dog that snuggles against the burglar. 

  
**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
\* Definitely not. That is, we'd rather avoid that as much as we can.

  
**17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
\* Apart from the obvious (aggressiveness) really only barking and the kind of hyperactivity that makes it tough to keep calm at the leash. My partner had a beagle growing up and he has some horror stories.  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
\* Virtually never, we both work from home.

  
**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**   
\* My partner will take care of them just as much as me and we're making this post together.

  
**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
\* No other pets  
**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
\* Eventually we hope so! No plans yet but we do want to have kids.

  
**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
\* We'll be owners.

  
**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
\* Italy, I'm not sure but I'm confident it won't impact the choice of breed considering our preferences.

  
**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**  
\* Summer: around 90 to 95 degrees, Winter: around 55 degrees.

2023-10-30,1698677936,Just curious: How bad are these pure/designer breed dog allergy problems and what are the worst stories you've heard so far?,"I have a two-year-old Labradoodle. We got him from a breeder in Illinois. We chose to get a Labradoodle because my wife has dog allergies and thought a hypoallergenic breed would be the better bet (we know it's never for sure hypoallergenic). We absolutely love him. He's got such an awesome temperament and personality, we trained him to be a therapy dog and make visits to the local hospital together. 

However, since he was about 6 months old, we've been dealing with allergy/gastrointestinal issues. We went through chicken, lamb, beef, and salmon foods, which all ended up causing issues after a while. We now exclusively use Zuke's Mini Peanut Butter and the vet started him on the Purina Pro Plan HA vegetarian diet. A month later, he started throwing up again, so we are looking into trying either the Royal Canin HP or Hill's Prescription Z/D. We've done those blood works that get sent to Texas (Trypsin-Like Immunoreactivity Protein, Cobalamin &amp; Folate Panel - Canine (ChL); it came back all within ranges. If this issue persists, we would have to look deeper into IBD and get an endoscopy, to my understanding. 

It's all worth it because we consider our dog a child and an integral part of our family. But I just want to ask and see just how bad the allergy/gastrointestinal issues exist in pure/designer breed dogs, as our vet had suggested to us that it is the population experiencing the most problems of this nature due to breeding practices. Also, don't you foresee this becoming a more common problem as this kind of breeding practice continues? But again, if breeders don't continue to breed dogs like puddles, puddle mixes, and schnauzers, how could people with allergies enjoy the companionship of a dog? Plus, is there a way to ethically breed these dogs, or is this just an inevitable consequence of dog breeding regardless of how careful? 

Experts, please educate me on what you think of this issue and if you see a fix perhaps by government regulations in dog breeding. ",dogs,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jvbup/just_curious_how_bad_are_these_puredesigner_breed/

2023-10-30,1698634149,"Advice on a breed for a first time dog owner, thank you in advance","Hi, my fiance and I are looking to get our first dog. Would love some insight on what kinds of breeds would be suitable for us.

1. **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**  
Yes, this will be our first dog. We both grew up with dogs but this is going to be the first dog that we are completely responsible for.
2. **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?**  
Fine with either, our priority is getting a healthy dog of a breed that is a good fit for us.
3. **Describe your ideal dog.**  
Our ideal dog would be very sweet and friendly. They would love to spend time on the couch with us, go to parks, restaurants, breweries, road trips, camping, etc. We'd love a dog that is capable of going on 3-5 (maybe more) mile hikes or runs. Having a general friendly demeanor is extremely important to us.
4. **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**  
We both love medium-sized Goldendoodles. They are friendly, we like the look and feel of their coats, their low shedding. We also love Golden Retrievers and Samoyeds for the same reasons, except Goldens and Samoyeds might be too large for us.
5. **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**  
Basic commands and behaviors like sit, lie, stay, etc. Walking without tugging or pulling. No jumping on people.
6. **Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**  
The only sport we'd like our dog to do is some running. I am a triathlete and it would be great to have a dog that I can run with.
7. **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**  
I work from home so I'll be with the dog nearly all day long most days. As far as dedicated time specifically for the dog, probably 60-90 mins a day
8. **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**  
30-60 mins a day of exercise. More on weekends. Especially going on regular runs with the dog would be great. We would also like to take the dog to dog parks and dog beaches
9. **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**  
Willing to brush 3-4x a week. Absolutely willing to all kinds of grooming at home and yes, also willing to pay for professional grooming and cleaning as needed
10. **What size dog are you looking for?**  
medium sized, about 25-40 pounds. We are willing to flex here for the right breed
11. **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**  
Would like to minimize all three as much as possible. One of the reasons we love Goldendoodles is the lack of shedding.
12. **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**  
Pretty important. We'd like to take it to dog parks and beaches
13. **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**  
Snuggly
14. **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?**  
Eager to please
15. **How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**  
We would prefer a dog that is friendly to everyone. We don't want a security dog and we strongly prefer that a dog be friendly towards bad actors than accidentally be hostile to friends / visitors.
16. **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**  
Ideally no, friendliness towards other dogs would be ideal
17. **Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?**  
Excessive barking
18. **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**  
When I'm out running errands, so probably 3-4x a week for a few hours at a time
19. **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**  
None, my fiance and I live in our own home
20. **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**  
We have an older cat that we absolutely adore. He is very mellow and calm. The health and happiness of our cat is crucial to us, so a dog with a friendly disposition is a must
21. **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**  
We are planning to start trying for children next year
22. **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**  
No
23. **What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**  
San Diego, CA. No
24. **What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

2023-10-30,1698625721,Super Chewer Advice,"Hi! I have a 1.5 year old lab who I absolutely adore. However, she is hands down the heaviest chewer I have ever seen and lately, her chews that ""last"" aren't cutting it for her and she's been finding other items to chew on, like her bed!

  
I have tried everything labeled for ""super chewers"" and without a doubt, she has gone through them so quick. I've tried yak chews, which she loves, but they last 15-20 minutes max. I even put them in holders to 1) prevent choking and 2) slow her down but she absolutely demolishes yak chews despite the obstacle. I got her beef cheek rolls, which seems to be the only chew that has taken her the longest to get through (maybe 30-40 minutes). She has it down to a science where she will use her front teeth to pick at the chew, in addition to gnawing on it with her back teeth.  
I'm looking for advice on natural chews to get her that will last her awhile! I understand every dog (labs especially) are different, but I don't mind trial and error until I find one that lasts. Also, she tends to hyper fixate on the chew and will not stop until she has finished it, so any advice on how to get her to take a break so chews can last longer?

  
Note - I am looking for natural chews, no rawhide. She has had Benebones and Nylabones which last a decent while, but I really would prefer finding her some natural chews. I even would take toy recommendations, I just want to make sure she's getting her playing time in, in addition to the physical exercise and mental stimulation that I already give her!",dogs,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17jgy7s/super_chewer_advice/

2023-10-29,1698609694,How did you introduce your adult dog to a kitten?,"About 3 weeks ago, we adopted a little runt kitten as an ESA for my 17 year old daughter named Misa. Eventually, shell be going off to college with my daughter but for right now, she is staying at
at my home. This is the first time Ive owned a cat and so far, its been amazing! Shes the sweetest, most gentle soul and loves my daughter. 

We also have a dog, an almost 3 year old Corgi that Ive had since Jan 2021. Hell be turning 3 on Halloween. His name is Mello &amp; well&.hes far from it. = Hes very vocal, to the point it can be excessive. Ive been training him on my own &amp; with a trainer since hes been here but for how expensive the training was, it did little to improve his stubbornness. Due to that &amp; my own financial state at the time, I had to stop the sessions. Hes very food motivated and smart but hes not very good at listening, otherwise. Hes also great with other dogs- so I thought it would be a bit of an easier transition bringing another fur baby into the home. 

My issue- it hasnt been. Ive done a lot of research &amp; reading about how important it is for both animals to interact at their own pace. And for whats its worth, they have met a few times face to face. But never without one hissing &amp; the other hyper fixating. Before she came, I practiced recalling, positive reinforcement, re introducing the crate when he misbehaves but the moment he noticed her, he hasnt stopped. Now the barking went from excessive to downright unnecessary. 

We have 3 gates, one being in my daughters room &amp; I thought maybe it was for the best that they can interact through the gate. The problem is, my dog barks so much at her that shes scared to come to the gate. I know its the excitement but to someone else or a kitten, it can easily be mistaken for aggression. From the moment he wakes til he goes to bed, he is at the gate. 

Ive been at my wits end. I love Mello from the moment I saw him &amp; the quirks that make him him, but I want Misa to feel like this is her home,  too.

2023-10-29,1698543007,Breed Questionnaire,"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog. I have no prior experience with dogs.

  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I don't have a preference.

  
Describe your ideal dog.

I'm looking for a medium - large sized breed that is lower energy. I need the dog to be trained at least somewhat easily and I can't have a dog that is to reactive because I have children that come in for a class at my home every day. Also, I'm really looking for a dog that is loyal and supportive of me and my family members. I'd prefer a more cuddly dog, but I'm just as ok with a dog that is more on the independent side. One thing I'm trying to avoid with breeds is an excessive amount of drooling and shedding.

  
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Number one on my list right now is a Bernese Mountain Dog, I think they're beautiful dogs and I love how they're a larger breed that are super cuddly(or so YouTube videos say). I'm also considering a Great Dane due to their large size and more chill nature and loving personality. Other than that, I have been considering a Great Pyrenees because of their temperament and looks. Lastly, I'd love a German Shepherd but I've seen that they can be a lot to handle and I'm not sure if that's for me.

  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I want all basic commands at least. So sit, down, stay, come. I'd also like to be able to train heel and stop commands.

  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, my dogs are going to be purely family dogs.

  
Care Commitments  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

For me, I have at least 4 hours a day open for interacting with my dog. I have a relatively busy schedule both working and studying but I'd squeeze every minute of my free time just to be with my dog.

  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I should be able to give my dog up to 2 hours of exercise time a day if they really need it. It would typically involve walks around the neighborhood or parks that are close by. I'm unsure if there is a dog park in may area but I'd make an attempt to go to one if there is one.

  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I would be fine doing brushing, cleaning of ears and teeth, and of course baths when needed. I will need help of a professional for more sensitive or intensive grooming needs like trimming nails or doing trimming if needed.

  
Personal Preferences  
10) What size dog are you looking for?

medium - large breeds

  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Ideally, I'd like to keep all of those to a minimum, but I am fine with shedding as long as it is not completely out of control. I'd like to avoid slobber and I'd also try to keep barking to a minimum due to other people in my home.

  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I'd love to be able to have my dog off leash because I like the thought of having my dog as more of a companion rather than just a pet. I think they deserve the freedom as long as they don't run away or fight something.

  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I'd love to have a snuggly dog.

  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

I lean more towards eager-to-please.

  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I'd like to keep growling or barking to a minimum. I want my dog to be wary of strangers but not aggressive or overly defensive.

  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Absolutely, I don't want to be that owner that has an aggressive dog that is a threat to others.

  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I'd like to avoid jumping on people even if it's just being friendly. I have new people and small children in the house quite often so I'd rather try to keep possible injuries to a minimum.

  
Lifestyle  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Almost never, I live with 2 stay at home parents who only go out occasionally for errands.

  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My parents would like a dog that isn't too messy or energetic. Overall, the main thing is to have a breed that isn't wild and to keep all of our furniture intact and undamaged.

  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

No we don't have and don't plan to have any other pets.

  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Sort of. We have children come in for a class 4 times a week for about 2 hours.

  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I plan to rent in the future, that is still at least 2-3 years out so I haven't begun researching yet.

  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in Valencia, California(basically Los Angeles) and I'm not aware of any laws that ban breeds.

  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winter: minimum 28 degrees Fahrenheit

Summer: Max 110 degrees Fahrenheit

That house has a decent fenced in yard (say 0.6 acres). 

Travel to and from that house is 2-2.5 hours so the dog would have to be fine in a car that long.  I have a big SUV so plenty of room.

2023-10-29,1698581045,help me pick a future second dog!!,"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Young adult so I just got my current puppy, 9 mo old Samoyed who is my first adult dog but my family has had 5+ rescued mutts/beagles.  Fostered 8 dogs (4 mos-4 yrs) and dog sit really regularly for people. Experience with basic training: leash, crate, potty, recall, etc but nothing fancy yet. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference, my samoyed was adopted from a local shelter :). 

I am not a fan of baby puppies (under 5 months) so if I went through a breeder especially for working type dogs like Mini American Shep I would look for a program to buy an adult or show dog :) 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Moderate energy levels that would enjoy ~2 hrs of training and exercise a day. 

Ive enjoyed having a biddable dog that enjoys interacting, being able to be taught off leash etc but my life will change a lot and will likely always live in a big city so im flexible with that stuff. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Ive enjoyed a lot of dog breeds, not super interested in tiny toy breeds but 20lbs+ is great.

Dont like Goldens and no doodles. Dont like daschunds, shih tzus, KCS, border collie, Great Pyr, bassett hounds, large hounds. And dont think english bulldogs/pugs/frenchies would keep up with our lifestyle. 

I like poodles, Boxers, climber spaniel, mini american shepherds, labs, larger pomerian/pom mixes, spitzes, shiba, beagles, mastiff, bully mixes (I like the bigger lower energy mixes of like am bully dog, not the smaller pit mixes) 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Really strong obedience, CGC, therapy dog work if a good fit. Trick training if they would like. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

Would be fun to try a sport like agility or luring but not sure in the city i would have the time sadly. No experience!

For working dogs I love love them but obviously dont really have the time but i do love Mini Americans. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

4+ hours. Exercise is realistically 1.5-2.5 hours a day and training+enrichment+ fetch in the house. I work from home 3 days a week currently but would always hire a sitter or low volume daycare if they needed. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

1.5-2 hours exercise that is available easily in the city. tons of green space but I am not a running so walking, city hikes, long line/off leash fetch and play with other dogs is a realistic day. 2-4 miles a day of walking so nothing crazy. Im not a runner or biker or anything like that. 

Whats important is I want a dog that can keep up with that exercise and be able to do short hikes - 5 miles is probably max. 

I basically do go to a dog park (owners congregate in an unfenced local park) but i wouldnt go if i had issues with the other dogs or owners. Apartment dog parks are usually 1-4 dogs at a time. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I have a samoyed so 2-3 times a week brushing, self washing 4-7 weeks, and paying a professional occasionally. This would be for the future so if i had the money for regular professional grooming I would. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

20lb-60lb is probably ideal but i could go slightly bigger.  

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not a fan of excessive barking. Others is fine! 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Pretty important. But wouldnt mind a long line dog but I wouldnt want a door dasher in the city. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Medium! Doesnt need to follow me into the bathroom every time or be touching me 24/7 but I like them sleeping in my bed. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Alert barking is fine but I want friendly with strangers but I do love mastiffs =-

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Nope - have another dog and he loves being with other dogs. Dont mind managing leash reactivity. 

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Separation anxiety or destructive tendencies. 

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I currently work from home 3 days a week and dont imagine i would ever work in an office 5 days a week but would definitely hire a walker and would consider sending them to a low volume daycare or a sitter who has other dogs but that would get pricey for two so ideal just a walker for office days. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Just me. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Samoyed - 9mos. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No but would want kids eventually and they would hopefully still be around 

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Yes - not renting now still living with family this would be for the future. The main breeds Ive seen restricted is shepherd, huskys, rottweilers, corsos, danes, akita, pitbulls, am bulldog, some mastiffs. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Neighbor counties ban pit bulls but i wouldnt live there. 

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 85-90
Winter: 45 
Summer wouldnt be doing much exercise outside unless they needed it since i have the samoyed.",dogs,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17j1i0q/help_me_pick_a_future_second_dog/

He gets worked up, starts barking and running around the house with his hackles up. We try to distract with treats, play and affectionbor training but it only works sometimes, it's like he can't hear us.

2023-10-28,1698529577,Future Family Dog- Bigger Breed are a,"(Edit for spelling. Sorry for my misspelling and typos. This long questionnaire is hard on my phone)

What are your opinions based on my answers?


**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Loads of experience! Ive been a dog owner to big, small, breeder pups and rescues. We always had a family dog and the moment I lived on my own 20 years ago, Ive had a dog. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

While Ive had rescues for the last 15 years, Im wanting to though a breeder this time. We have small children and rescues sometimes come with unique personalities that show up unexpectedly. While I know this can happen with puppies, it feels like a better bet to take.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Not too much exercise, easy to train but not so smart that they ruin furniture because they are bored, not big barkers or high pitch barks, can handle kids (respectfully) playing with them and wont nip if they accidentally get stepped or fell on (basically good with small children), gets a long well with other dogs and possibly cats (if we get one in the future), loves to cuddle, funny/ goofy, and ideally doesnt shed fine hairs. Not a jumper! 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I love the Bernese Mountain dogs because they are loving, smart and low energy. Im hesitant because of the massive shedding, the local Los Angeles weather and most of all, their short life span.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Sit, stay, and down. Were not competing in dog shows over here& just the basics. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

Absolutely not. Our kids are what take up our time, not a dog show. We want a dog that can fit into our busy lifestyle without being needy. With that said, were home quite a bit because of working from home. 

**Care Commitments**

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

We work from home 2-3days a week, we would do training up front during the puppy stage then nothing additional once they understand our boundaries and the basics. Would love to take them on vaccinations they are dog friendly.

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

30 min walks tops. Also& arent dog parks actually bad for dogs because it gives them anxiety?

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Id pay for grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

50+ pounds. We want a bigger dog. 

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Ugh this is tricky because I know that bigger dogs usually have all of this. I could handle the shedding but I cannot handle a barker. 

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

Not too important but ideally wed have a dog that would stay next to us. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggle! But not a lapdog.  Just one that enjoys being near us and follows us around. We love our pets. 

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I want one that doesnt give a shit. We live in the city and the last thing I want is a dog going crazy every time the UPS or Amazon truck even drives by.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. I dont want an aggressive dog.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Did I mention I dont want a barker?

**Lifestyle**

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Maybe 8-10 hrs 2 days a week and then 4-5 hours tops on a Saturday if were at kids birthday party, for example. Most days itd only be for a couple hours. 

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Same as mine. 

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Possibly a cat and a bearded dragon in our distant future. 

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes! Lots of interaction with young children.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own. No restrictions. 

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Nope.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summer: 80
Winter: 65

I have two dogs (one 14 and the other 5) and there is one thing that really amazes me about their senses above all else.  I am clearly their preferred human as I spend a lot of time with them since I work from home.  We do a lot of things together but we also lounge around a fair bit too.  

There are many times where the entire family is sitting watching tv with the dogs napping in the same room.  If any other family member gets up to grab a drink or whatever, the dogs dont budge.  Theyre sleeping after all.  But if I get up, they both pop up instantly.  And its not because theyre closer to where I am.

Thats just CRAZY to me that they can somehow sense who is moving and who isnt while napping. Ive experimented with it and it pretty much never fails.

His best friend is Casper (1,5 years, German Shepard) and they had a misunderstanding. 

Casper is super dominant and gets jealous pretty easily (he doesnt like to play with toys with other dogs, hates when other dogs get attention, even by their own humans, that kind of stuff). They like to chase each other and get along pretty well. 

On their last play date Caspers owners didnt tell us (I guess they forgot) that there is a toy in the corner of the garden. Bowie accidentally laid on it (he wanted to show Casper his tummy) but Casper thought Bowie wants his toy I guess and bit him. It was horrendous Bowie whined and my BF needed to get them apart. But as soon as Casper let go, Bowie wanted to play again (even tho he was bleeding from both of his ears and his chin a little bit) and Casper was super confused and looked guilty or scared too& 

His owners are great, they apologized, wrote us every other day if Bowie is okay& We are not mad at them or anything we are just glad Bowie is okay.

Since then Bowie met his other friends and is still the same - his very best, silly, friendly, self. So we feel extremely lucky that he is not traumatized, and his wounds are also okay&

But Im kinda scared to let him play with Casper again. He still looks for him and stops at his garden to see if hes there somewhere. I think he misses him.

2023-10-28,1698457741,Inappropriate Urination,"Seeking some advice on training resources! I have a 3 year old spayed Lurcher who we have been unable to make much progress on with potty training. For some background on her, we made her part of our family in early April. Were uncertain of her past before us, but we were told she was an outdoor dog prior to us. She did well and had no accidents for the first week, then she started peeing in the house. We established a strict schedule for potty breaks in combination with crating. Over time there were some improvements, but she continued to pee indoors. 

We took her to a vet that the rescue had approved where they did a urinalysis. She came back completely normal. We figured she was just a slow learner and continued with the schedule. Her schedule is potty at wake-up around 6am, again at 11, 12:30, 4, 7, and 9pm. We gave her access to water during the day, but we took it away overnight since she has a proclivity to chug the entire bowl and immediately pee. After months we were only having accidents a few times a week. Then she regressed and started peeing all the time indoors again. 

Her crate is appropriately sized for her. She has no problem peeing on herself and in her bed without hesitation. She will pee on furniture that isnt hers too. Its not marking behavior, shes fully emptying her bladder. Because of the regression we decided to take her to the vet clinic we work at instead of the one the rescue initially sent us to. We did bloodwork, another urinalysis, a urine culture, and changed her food to urinary prescription diet. She has been on the urinary diet for over a month. All of her testing came back normal with the exception of a few crystals in her urine. Those resolved quickly with the prescription diet, but no improvements to inappropriate urination. 

Her vets are thinking this is a combo of mild incontinence and behavioral urination. We will be putting her on Proin and would also like to do some training at home while we save up for behaviorist. Its also noteworthy that she is very dim. No, not stubborn. Really dumb. Shes the sweetest dog, not a single mean bone or thought in her. Ive been working with animals for over half a decade and she astounds me with her lack of comprehension sometimes. Everyone at the clinic is in agreement that its not stubbornness or disobedience, she wants to be good, she just doesnt understand how.

The Royal Canin Satiety dry food was amazing. Like, literally amazing. He lost weight, his stool was perfect, he liked it.

BUT, my youngest daughter has Celiac Disease, and we try to keep our house as gluten-safe as it can be for her. What makes the Royal Canin Satiety work (super-low caloric content relative to weight of food) is that it has so much filler in it, and much of that filler is wheat. 

SO, we've been trying low-fat/low-calorie foods that are also strictly gluten-free (and also pea-free) which is a tough needle to thread. I'd love to find something that approaches the caloric content of the Royal Canin Satiety Support - it really is a sweet spot for us. To get his weight under control with regular ""light"" foods, I have to really restrict the amount that I'm giving him, which makes him crazy hungry and he starts chowing on sticks/leaves/etc.

Does anyone have any thoughts on any specific options? All I can really do is google and search Chewy. My vets are super nice but didn't have any ideas other than switching to fresh food, which isn't out of the question, I'd just rather keep it as a last resort (cost and convenience relative to dry food, also my other dog who's picky already would go on a hunger strike if the lab started getting real food).

2023-10-27,1698421648,"How to stop 11w Bichon puppy from jumping around legs on walks, risk of hurting her.","My 11w bichon has just started to go on short walks, basically just training to walk in leash. At some times she does well.

But generally she will at one point get too exited, usually when people has passed us/and or she got to say hi to some of these people. At this point she is very exited and starts jumping, sometimes nipping at my legs, running around my legs and sounding like a little pig with her tiny play-growls. 

I am happy she is happy, but i try to correct this and have time out when she gets too excited, i basically hold her harness and push down her butt into sitting position and just wait until she relaxes. Last time though she just got more and more upset by my time outs, whining and shaking and sometimes wriggling a bit. She calms for like 5 seconds but is still kind of tense. Its cold and maybe that is part of why she is tense? So i start walking her again and she is right back at the playing. 

I am really afraid of stepping on her and hurting her actually. Once i accidentally kicked her when she got in the way and somehow she just thought i was playing with her and that got her going even more. 

A big issue is that when she feels the leash go tight she gets excited. So what will happen is this: 
1. She runs ahead of me, i stop which makes the leash go tight. She will try once more.
2. Then she will bite the leash and start jumping around and growl/playing and just beeing a zoomie maniac. 
3. I try to time-out her crazyness.
4. She will whine and shake. 
5. I let go (maybe too quick?) and she will go off again in her crazy. 
6.  We repeat process above. 

Should i just pick her up? Its cold here in sweden now and i almost feel she might think of it as a reward.

2023-10-27,1698431749,My dog doesn't like when I use my desktop computer.,"Hello everyone,

I've only just now thought of creating a post about it somewhere, although it's been happening for quite a while. Just a lighthearted thread, just something mildly interesting to me and I wonder if you guys have any ideas on why such a thing might be happening.

Well, my dog really doesn't like when I use the computer, my desktop specifically. I am now typing this in my bed on my laptop, my dog tucked in next to me. The desktop is on (so it's not about some weird radio waves or anything of such nature), but if I stood up and went to my desk right now, my dog would become alert, and leave the room once I sit in the chair and/or interact with my desktop. I find this interesting, since when she was younger, that wasn't the case. I can't really put my finger on how long this has been happening for. I'm pretty sure the timeline is as such: before I bought my PC a year ago I had used a gaming laptop as my desktop (since 2017), my dog was fine with staying in the room while I played games or used it, then at some point she started having a problem with it, but it was still pre-PC era.

This may be just her getting old, but I suppose some of you here have extensive knowledge on dogs, in case there is a possible explanation to this. I've considered her having a problem with me talking out loud on Discord, yet she is fine when I do it next to her on my laptop or on the phone, so that's out. The computer is now on and she is sleeping next to me in the bed, so it's not just the computer working (waves, fans, electicity, whatever).

I have no idea guys, she is a very attached dog that hates to stay alone and always cuddles up with someone whenever she can, so it has to be something very disturbing about me using specifically the desktop for her to choose being alone in some other room over being with me while I use my PC.

Looking forward to reading your ideas or questions!

Edit/P.S.: Also, i often watch movies or YouTube on my phone/laptop next to her. People speaking, guns shooting (gaming videos), weird goofy sounds - she doesn't even flinch. I could play a recording of a barking dog and MAYBE SOMETIMES she would raise her ears or wake up and side-eye me.",dogs,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17hu98m/my_dog_doesnt_like_when_i_use_my_desktop_computer/

I just wanted to get your take on why this happens.

I have the most amazing red wirehaired dachshund. He is very robust and never afraid of anything. Not any humans or other dogs. He is very domineering with other dogs actually. Therefor I wonder why he hides under the bed if anyone in the household gets angry or frustrated. And I am not speaking of any major outburst or anything dramatic. He reacts that way even if it is very subtle, and sometimes I dont even recognise my frustration before he already is hiding. This is the only time he does this? 
And this is a dog that doesnt care about things like fireworks. He is very brave but very sensitive to mood changes in the home. We are never violent or anything like that. Can someone explain?

2023-10-27,1698433446,[Assistance Dog Breeds],"Assistance dog breeds (UK)
25yo. Financially stable part time veterinary nurse looking for multipurpose assistance dog prospect. 

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I own 2 dogs, whippet and S Poodle. I work as a veterinary nurse so a decent amount of experience with dogs but more experience with sighthounds (not a consideration for new addition). 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Looking for an assistance dog (UK) prospect. I currently have a whippet and S Poodle. It would be a multipurpose psychiatric and physical assistance dog (mainly for PTSD, FND/CFS &amp; Fibro amongst other things) 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* NOT Labradors. I love them so much but am allergic. = 
Current cons are (TW Pet Illnesses):
- Golden R: Lots of hair! I work as a vet nurse so not hugely bothered by it but definitely a consideration. Also, I do quite like my unique looking dogs!
- Flatcoats &amp; Bernese MD: Also hairy. They both get cancer = BMD have quite a short lifespan
- Stan Poodle: Absolutely gorgeous but these guys are loopy. Very put off with how easily overstimulated they seem, too. 
- GSD &amp; Collies: Previous bite history makes me kinda wary of the breed, but Im working on it!
- Doberman: Not many breeders in UK. Issues with insuring these with my AD training charity. Crossbreeds: Not a huge fan of crossbreeds because of difficulty determining what you may get.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Assistance dog tasks. Retrieval, cortisol detection and intervention of behaviours associated. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No sports, but technically working as AD. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work 2 days a week. The rest are for my dogs and my self care. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Up to 60 minutes on good days. When I have flare-ups I currently exercise my two using sniffy walks and enclosed free roam as opposed to structured walks which are on more stable days. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Minimal-ish. I have a S Poodle, but pref no more than that. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal, but again, fairly used to it with my job. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important. It would need to hold a stay for public access. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I feel snuggly would be more appropriate here as they would be spending a large portion of their time by my side. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please for sure. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* No reaction, preferably. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not in my household, no. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Only ones Ive mentioned, such as lack of reactivity/barking/noise etc but I appreciate some of that would be training too. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Two days a week I work, but I take my dog with me. They will get toiled before I start work at 8:30 and again around lunchtime, then back home and reg routine can continue. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My partner does not have any preferences. He will help on poor flare up days but he has minimal involvement with the dogs. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I have 2 other dogs as mentioned. I also have 2 ferrets but they do not interact with the dogs and are housed separate. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No. I do not have kids or plan to. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes. None except bully breeds but I wouldnt consider them. 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* UK - 4 banned breeds incl Pitties. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

She also does this when we are inside the train or bus. If we dont move for a long period then she starts whining.. which is a bit embarrassing for the other passengers.

We have been trying to mentally stimulate her as much as possible, but she is a smart smart cookie and gets through all of the games we have set up way too quickly.

passing by, we have played with brand new toys. However, I dont feel like any of this is enoughwhich is very apparent with her energy level still.

Just so Im not saying the same thing over and over, thank you for all your comments assuring me its completely normal and that for so many of you it got better with time. Its already helped me so much I felt so trapped in these feelings and they were getting worse because its all I could think about but I feel so relieved now and theyre already annoying me less just knowing that its not forever. I think I am more hormonal than I thought I was too because Ive been fine mentally and not emotional I think I keep forgetting that Ive literally just had a baby and Im actually going through a crazy time no matter how well Ive managed to adapt. Hopefully the (majority) responses to this post will help somebody in the future if they are searching for it like I was before I posted. 

Looking for positive stories about dogs (that you already had) after babies. For context incase it matters, I have two 5 year old male (neutered) Beagles.

Im looking for anybody that might of been through similar but it turned around. Since having my baby 6 weeks ago, I no longer like my dogs. I find everything about them annoying and the bad habits they have that I used to think were soooooo cute make me absolutely enraged. I assume its the hormones and being touched out from looking after a tiny human 24/7 and not ever getting a break from that because this is seriously out of character for me. A year ago I would of died for my dogs. We paid the price of a house deposit to emigrate them across the world with us because we never for a moment considered rehoming them and being in a better financial position (we are literally currently renting because of this decision). I have always thought of them like my children but all of a sudden I can see they are dogs.

I think I still love them, but I just really dont like them right now. I cant explain it, I dont want them near me I dont find them cute or want to spend time with them.

Hello =K 

our family has been on a trial adoption with beautiful greyhound Abbi for the last two weeks and love her very much. i think she is settling in very well, but some of the only problems are : she sheds HEAPS, and she has a lot of energy. 

like, we brush her for 10 minutes and get about five cups of hair come off (and there's still more!!!!). anywhere she sits in will have heaps of hair after two minutes. 

i have taken her out for two walks, one for 20 minutes and one for 40 everyday, but she still is very hyper and wanting more. no one in the family has the capacity to take her out for much longer, and the nearest off leash and fenced park is 20 + minutes away. we can only really fit that in on weekends. 

two of the main reasons we got a greyhound is because they don't shed much (and we were told abbi didn't at all) and that they are very chill

has anyone else had this happen? will it stop as she settles or can this happen the rest of her life? any advice would be amazing. 
 we really love her but two of our family are very allergic to dog fur, and we don't have the capacity to support her getting out for over two walks a day. 

any advice would be amazing, we really want this to work out !!",dogs,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17mt4gg/advice/

2023-11-02,1698958666,Does your dog ever leap up and nose-dive/pounce down like a fox hunting in the snow? What is the purpose when not hunting?,"Sometimes, very rarely, my dog leaps up vertically into the air, tilts his body down and pounces head-first below with his paws out. The only thing I can compare it to is a [fox hunting in the snow](https://imgur.com/a/k4vjCeM). 

Ive never really see a dog do this so nimbly and fox-like before; normally his pounces are smaller and less dramatic. Im wondering if its common and what it triggers it. My dog very rarely ever does it, but he so far he has with the following:

1. Hunting insects in the grass
2. Nose-diving into the couch when playful
3. Playing with the cat

Obviously number 1 makes sense, but one time I saw him doing it repeatedly in the yard. At first I thought for sure he found a mouse or something, but then I noticed he was by the cat. He was pouncing around her like he was playing, but it looked like a hunting technique. 

He wasnt pouncing *on* her, just jumping up and landing beside her. He loves the cat and always gets playful, but thats the first time I saw him do that around her.

Me he doesnt bite actually, I dont know if ita some powerbattle that he has with my girlfriend now? But my gf is really worried now because the puppy isnt really ""golden retriever like"" at all yet. He is really independent and for example really throws himself against the leash to the point where he is choking if we take him outside and dont move because he is pulling. He doesnt like to be cuddled and as said is really biting hard sometimes. We train him by stopping the play immediately as he bites. But yeah is this normal for these young puppies? Or is this individual just a bit more stubborn than usual and will turn out to be good boy with training and when he gets older. Just want to hear peoples experience and recommendations.

2023-11-02,1698962777,This shit is hard.,"A disclaimer before I clear my mind; the love I have for my dog is nothing Ive ever experienced. I would probably jump in front of a car for her, Id drain my bank account for her, and half the time she gets better meals and sleep than me and her dad. 
My boyfriends dad rescued a heavily pregnant stray about a year ago. We ended up taking one of the pups. Shes a purebred American Staffy. A beautiful brindle girl. She quickly became the light of our lives.
I have always been a cat person. I grew up with Rotties, Dobermans, Basset Hounds. I absolutely love dogs. But my energy matches with cats 100% more than it does with energetic dogs. 
The first 3 months arent even the hardest. I could hold her in one hand and shed sleep on my lap while I did my makeup. Her pungent puppy breath spread all over my face while she kissed me was a highlight of my day.
Fast forward to about 7 months; things quickly became extremely stressful. I continued to tell my partner before we even got her, that we both work full-time, we are both working towards our career, and that we would need to sacrifice a lot of time for her. Her breed is naturally high energy. But I was not prepared for the multiple pairs of chewed shoes, the constant potty accidents, the frustration when she doesnt remember commands; the list goes on.
She recently got spayed, and having to constantly watch to make sure she isnt licking the wound, jumping around, or rough housing is so time consuming. My stress levels have been through the roof. Between working full time, starting a business, paying bills and just life in general, its actually really freakin hard. 
I dont have children, but I helped raise a set of premature twins. And I can say with confidence, I would rather have a baby than raise another puppy at this time in my life.
Im not looking for criticism, or even sympathy. I suppose I just wanted to clear my mind and find solace in knowing Im not the only cat-person but also dog-loving person who is quite overwhelmed with this whole thing. 
I also think its a good reminder that a puppy, or any aged dog for that matter, is a HUGE commitment. Be 100% ready, know for certain you have the support and resources to raise a dog the right way.

2023-11-02,1698945010,Looking to get Rottweiler Puppy by Next Summer,"DISCLAIMER: If you disagree with a person purchasing from a breeder then please scroll. I just need recommendations not a lecture. I have adopted dogs from shelters before and probably will again later in life. The process of adopting is rather difficult and youre not even guaranteed to get approved. I just want a puppy. Thats it.

With that being said, if you got your Rottweiler puppy from a breeder, would you mind dropping a link to their website if youve had a good experience with them? Im from upstate ny but cant seem to find reputable breeders. Im also willing to travel so no worries on location.

No this will not be my first dog. Ive owned and trained two since I was a kid.

Whatever it takes to exercise and stimulate the dog all day.

**Personal Preferences**

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? Lots. Im very used to high energetic dogs. As well as the ones that slobber &lt;3

We got robbed once and it was because my dog saw someone coming but never barked because she got treats :/

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I understand where we went wrong, and I am simply looking for a way to make it work.","Let me start by saying, ""Please don't bash my family"". I understand where we went wrong, and I am simply looking for a way to make it work.

In December 2021, my mom picked up my dog from the shelter at this mass adoption event. No research was done on the breed, but she thought my dog was a beagle. After taking her to the vet, we learned she was a Treeing Walker Coonhound. The past year has been really rough because everyone in my house is either working or in school full-time, so my dog spends most of her day at home alone. We have a huge fenced-in yard, and my dad works from home, so she does spend time outside daily. 

But when we come home, it is a yelling match; she barks uncontrollably in our faces until she falls asleep. The first year wasn't terrible as I think she was getting used to new people, but now it is out of control. 

I try to walk her when I come home from work, but by the time I get home, it's dark out. I feel so bad for her bc I know her barking is because she is bored. I have tried buying kongs, lick mats, and even dog puzzle things. She is an intelligent dog, and finished the puzzles in minutes. 

She does spend some time outside every day as we have a huge fenced-in yard. My dad works from home full time, so he does occasionally walk her during the day. On the weekends, when I am off, and on Fridays, I try to walk her for at least 2 miles. I also try to take her on errands with me just to give her a change of scenery. 

Additionally, the barking is taking a toll on my parent's marriage. My dad didn't want another dog (my labradoodle passed in the Spring of 2021), but my mom really wanted another one as her mother passed away in the same season. 

As the oldest daughter, I feel like it is my responsibility to rectify this issue before I move out next summer. It has honestly taken a toll on me hearing both of my parents complain about each other in regards to the dog. We are honestly stuck because we don't want to give her back or away because she has almost been with us for two years, but at the same time I also feel like we are doing her a disservice. 

 So again I ask for any advice, and to not bash my family bc I am really trying here.

Thank you in advance.

2023-11-02,1698933840,Dog breed for small apartment?,"
Hi, I am a veterinary student who lives in a small apartment with my boyfriend fairly central in the city. We both love dogs and are thinking about getting one in maybe a year. The thing is I love dog training and have taught activities like agility and nose work to my family dog and would love a breed who I can work with. However Im afraid that such a breed might not work to well in a busy city and small apartment. We have looked a bit into rescue dogs and seen that some greyhound mixes might work good for apartment but might not be so easily trainable. My boyfriend is also allergic to cats but doesnt seem to be allergic to dogs. However a hypoallergenic dog or at least a dog that doesnt shed too much might be good.

So does anyone know a breed that might work for our situation? Highly trainable yet will be comfortable relaxing in a small apartment?

 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Not my first dog, have trained my family dog (Portuguese water dog) in basic obedience, agility, some nose work and rally obedience.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder].

* There are so many dogs who need homes so I would like to rescue, however my family dog is from a breeder so I am not opposed to that.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Highly trainable, medium energy, someone who can go all out in training yet relax when home. Ideally a medium to big dog. A dog who can be by themselves for maybe up to four hours at a time. Love a dog who is food or play motivated. Maybe not too loud or guarding because I dont want to disturb neighbors. Doesnt shed too much.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Greyhound because there are many rescues and I have read that they adapt well to apartments. Working dog like a doberman or herding dog like a collie because of the trainability however afraid they might not work to well in an apartment. We have also looked at poodles because they can excel I agility and are hypoallergenic.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Would love agility, however I am down for any activity that the dog love like maybe nose work, discus, obedience or fly ball. The important thing is that I can work with the dog in some way at least.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* I would love to compete in for example agility and did that with my family dog on rookie level a couple of times until we found out she had arthritis.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Depends on the day but Id like to train basic obedience like heel, sit, stay, retrieve etc on every walk every day plus would like to train agility or something similar maybe once a week. So maybe altogether two hours a day? And obviously time to snuggle a couple of hours.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least one hour walk per day but probably 1,5 to two hours split up in three walks. I love playing and running around on the walks and will probably use a dogpark often because I live in the city, however there are rarely dogs using the park.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I will probably do the work myself and can do some work however I would like a dog who doesnt need daily work on their fur.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to giant.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Not to much shedding because of my boyfriends allergies, moderate amount of barking is okay but not all the time because I live in an apartment. Slobber is not problem.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Fairly important, I would love to be able to do that but can use a long leash if that is not possible.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Doesnt matter too much, a dog who wants to be close but it doesnt matter too much how cuddly they are.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Doesnt matter too much, maybe not too friendly or too hostile.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes, however I would like a dog who isnt too dog aggressive.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Not really, maybe people aggression.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not too long or often, up to four hours at the time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My boyfriend, doesnt have too much of a preference just not too much shedding.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No however the dog would have to stay with my parents or his parents if we were going away. My parents have a medium size dog and his parents have a small dog and a cat so that would have to work.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, maybe rent in the future but no restriction that I know of.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Sweden, Uppsala which is a pretty big city. No bans however Sweden doesnt accept for example pit bull as a breed because they have been bred for fighting in the past however other similar dogs like American staffordshire terrier are accepted.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Can be up to 30 C in the summer and -10 C during winter.",dogs,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17m47fz/dog_breed_for_small_apartment/

2023-11-02,1698916510,Teaching the leash. Please help. All the online articles do not work,"Hello kind souls, 

Can somone please help me teach my dog walk on a leash? Everything online that I read basically states 'wait for your dog to come to you and reward her'. This does not work because when my dog has got the leash on, she simply will not follow me, even when I take the treats out, she still wont follow me. She just looks scared like I'm punishing her. I am not pulling on the leash, I'm just holding it.

I tried to disentesise her to the lead but having her keep it on around the house (she doesn't seem to mind it after a few seconds, just goes about her day) but she just freezes the moment I pick it up. What can I do, any ideas? 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, she is a 9 month old rescue and has been with me for 4 weeks now. She had been in shelter almost from day one so I don't think she has got a negative association with the lead. She appears to have settled in well in my house and seems to trust me - almost too much as she just wants to follow me around everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please help, I'd really love to start taking her outside the house, but just can't do it until she gets it, we've been trying it for a week everyday and made zero progress.

Now, its gotten to an almost unbearable point. She has to be in the same room as me, staring at me, standing right next to me or wants to be on top of me 24/7. I will ask her to go into another room, and she will stand in the doorway and stare at me. If she is not getting constant attention, she whines and cries while sitting on the floor next to me. Im at my wits end. She is constantly following me and is underfoot, crying and staring unless shes on my lap or getting some kind of physical attention.

As they are getting up there, I worry that six months with next to no exercise will not be good for them. This summer I have really started building endurance in both of them, and I would like to maintain that during the winter. 

So which is better? A firepaw or a dogpacer? Im okay with the noise and size and price I f either, and Im leaning toward the firepaw because I really like the dog powered aspect of it. Im a little worried that my oldest wont be able to move it, but I figure I can move it by hand if I have to, but I wanted to know if anyone has experience with senior dogs on either. 

Both dogs can walk over a mile, and all Im hoping for is 15 minutes twice a day max for each. I know that can be a lot at a full out sprint, but they would go very slow, probably 2 mph or less for the older one as needed. 

I also have a younger dog who would love to get some sprints in on the really ugly days, and I would prefer the firepaw for that (I know you can only go so fast on a dogpacer) but hes happy going for a walk in almost all weather.

She is very kind and loves people and other dogs. Last night was Halloween and since she is a bit of a barker I thought it would be good to bring her outside so she can see that its okay for people to come to our house. It went pretty well, she didnt bark but a few times and I had my other friends out there to separate her from the candy, for kids who were scared of dogs. I held her in my lap whenever kids came up and most of the kids loved her and even wanted to pet her. For most of the kids she wagged her tail and accepted the pets no problem. However, there was one kid who came up and spoke really loud and pet her in a poking manner(just touching the top of her head with his fingertips instead of with a full hand). I work with kids and he was a bit older so I could tell he was on the spectrum. She was fine at first but then she started growling. I noticed but I dont think the kid did so I positioned my hand under her mouth just in case something happened. He went to get candy and she was fine but then he came back and she growled again and I think she tried to nip him but I covered her face so Im unsure if she was just showing her teeth. I didnt want to stop him and make him feel uncomfortable because I could tell he was so happy to see her and didnt mean any harm, this was probably wrong of me because I could tell she was uncomfortable. This is my first dog as an adult and I had no idea what to do. Afterwards, she went back to being fine, other kids came up and pet her and she was back to her happy self. The issue I have is that I am becoming an Occupational Therapist and was planning on getting her professionally trained when she is old enough so I could do sessions with her. Does anyone know how to prevent this? How can I normalize her to people that act differently?

Hello all, 

I currently have a 5 month old Catahoula puppy (f). I have a friend that has had some unforeseen life circumstances come up, and needs to re-home her 12 year old (f) Catahoula. 

The senior dog is in good health, well trained, well-tempered, and moderately active. According to the owner, she is good with other dogs, but may take a little time to warm up to them. 

I have read online that a puppy can either be great or not so great for a senior dog. My puppy is very energetic, but smart. My thinking is the senior dog could serve as a good model for my current puppy, as well as a companion. My fear is that my puppy would be too energetic for the older dog, constantly annoying her and tormenting her final years. 

Lastly, the alternative is taking the senior dog to a shelter. While I feel no genuine responsibility for this and dont have a savior complex, a small part of this has admittedly influenced my thinking. 

So what do we think - could this possibly benefit both dogs, or is this a recipe for disaster?",dogs,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17l44rm/thinking_of_adding_a_senior_dog_to_the_mix/
2023-11-01,1698840533,Should I Rehome my Australian Shepherds?,"I (23m) have two (2) 3-year-old Australian Shepards (unaltered). They are brothers that I purchased at 20 years old and have had them since they were 4 months old. For some context, I originally bought them with the support of a partner. We had a home in the suburbs with a large yard, an older more experienced dog, and multiple young cats. 

Today, I am by myself, we live in a small one-bedroom apartment, in a bustling metropolitan. Between work, school, and attempting to have a social life. I am finding it difficult to maintain a good quality of life for them. 

Based on a few incidents, I have begun to seriously consider rehoming them. I personally, can not keep up with their energy. I will be the first to admit, I did not do any research into breed type/characteristics, energy levels, etc& My former partner and I saw cute puppies that needed to be extracted from the situation they were in. This, I feel, has come back to bite me in the behind.

It is a challenge for me to afford all of their needs as well (vet costs/emergency care costs). As well as how much it would cost to board/rover, for out of town trips I want to take. I have completely self-trained, but as they are still relatively young, there are situations in which they have a hard time controlling themselves. I will also admit that our relationship is strained. I do not feel that they have a connection to me (sure theyre excited to see me when I get home, but they show the same excitement for any human/dog they encounter). 

I have heard from trusted friends and family with varying opinions. On one side, I have heard, I have not done enough to alleviate my concerns with them (alter them, walk/play more, take them to doggy daycare). On the other side, I have heard, that they (obviously) are not in the optimal environment and our circumstances will not significantly change for the better for a significant amount of time. Even with the passage of time, my attention to them would only decrease as my chosen profession demands much of me. 

I aim to be transparent in that I am in my early 20s and very much want to experience them. I believe there is a situation in which we all win here. As I am sure you all know, Australian Shepards have a life expectancy of 12-15 years. That is a significant commitment. I again admit, I did not (and should have) research anything about the breed (originally thought they were Golden Retrievers), and I am not facing the consequence of that oversight. 

In all, should I rehome, or hope things will turn around?

EDIT: I do also want to add: As they have been together with each other for their entire lives, any option that is not them being rehomed together is NOT an option. I can not do that to them. ",dogs,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17lamk5/should_i_rehome_my_australian_shepherds/
2023-11-01,1698841201,How do you fix reoccurring small patches of matting on a border collie,"So I have a gorgeous border collie, he is more robust and has fairly long fur and e have this problem where he gets his hair matted constantly even tho I always brush him but around certain spots on his body specifically under his ear on the bottom side of his tail and on his back he os really prone to Matting and as far as o can tell it's mostly caused by small bits of plant matter that might not come out when i brush him but that's just a guess.

Although also brushing and bathing is a big problem too he has so much energy no Matter how much we play or walk or run sometimes he just doesn't get tired but gets bored immediately and cannot stay in one place flr more than two seconds so he isn't stopping me from brushing by being annoyed or making noises at me, he just keep throwing the ball at me or runs away from me to sit down in a waiting position the same position he takes when he is waiting for me to throw the ball but if go there when he is laying down tp brush him he starts sprinting towards the ball.

Also i think he hates water, not when it rains he seems entirely unbothered by rain unless it's very heavy rain but if i try to get pour water on him with a shower head or anything really he acts like a cat.

\* Boston Terrier, Beagle, Fox or Rat Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Terrier/Poodle mix, or other similar mixed breed. We would prefer to have a small dog or a pair of small dogs that are even-tempered and playful. Dad has experience with larger breeds but is no longer able to care for a medium/large or large dog due to mobility limitations.  
\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\*   
\* Companionship, walking buddy.  
\*\*What experience do you have of owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?  
\* My dad had a Douchshound when he was younger, a Belgian Shepherd, a Lhasa Apso mix, and a Shepherd mix. Our last dog was a terrier mix that we rescued.   
\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?   
\* No other pets but wildlife.  
\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*   
\* No children.  
\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?  
\* My dad owns a house.  
\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  
\* My dad and I will both take care of the dog  
\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*  
\* Not often in fact we are usually the visitors to other people's homes.  
\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*   
\* We have had good experiences with rescue dogs. We have never used a breeder.  
\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   
\* Young is preferable because we want a dog to grow with us.   
\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)  
\* 12 -24 inches is what we are looking for.  
\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   
\* We would prefer a dog that is well-mannered and doesn't bark at every little distraction. One that is used to being around other animals is best.   
\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  
\* Some as long as the dog is accustomed to brushing and doesn't bite.  
\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.  
\* A trim by a pro is preferred. However, one of my dad's previous dogs required regular brushing.  
\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*   
\* We would have a pro do it.  
\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*   
\* Little slobber and at least quiet farts.  
\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*   
\* Eager-to-please is the big thing.  
\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*   
\* Basic obedience and potty training but willing to work with the dog and professional to better communicate with the dog and teach it basic commands like to come when called.

\* Aggressiveness of any sort.  
\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   
\* Not very due to the risk of other dogs and animals in the wild.  
\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   
\* A walk every day if weather permits (snow/ice during the winter) backyard play or even indoor play. We have access to a dog park as well, weather permitting.  
\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   
\* My dad is retired and enjoys exercising. In the past, he would take our dog on 1 to 1 ½ mile walks every day.  
\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*   
\* A crate when it might be alone otherwise inside of the house on the couch or dog bed.  
\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*

\* A dog walker or doggy daycare would be no problem

\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*

2023-10-31,1698795308,Breed recs please!,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
\* I had a dog as a a child, but not as an adult  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
\* I am currently planning on going through a responsible breeder, but I could be convinced to get a rescue dog if the health/temperment lottery aspect could be minimized (I am far from an expert)  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
\* I want a dog who would be down for most things. Most of the time pretty chill with one or two neighborhood walks a day - with the occasional hike of just a few miles. Able to play with friends dogs and children. I have cats so they absolutely have to get along with cats. If longer walks would be out of the question, that is better than too much energy. Dont want to have to worry about aggression or destruction.  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
\* I have always been enamored with the Cavalier King Charles. They are the size and temperament and cuteness I am looking for. However, the health issues give me pause. Have considered dogs liek shih-tzus, but to be honest, the smushy face dogs like that dont really do it for me. Many of the breedsi  have looked out have been ruled out for being too yippy.   
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
\* responsible behavior and maybe a few parlor tricks. Be chill and come along for the ride.  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
\* nope  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
\* 1 hour active, but plan to hang out with them most of every day, since I work from home and am fairly homebody-ish  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
\* Daily neighborhood walk, maybe weekly longer walk/hike/visit to dog park  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
\* I would brush a few times a week. Probably leave the rest to groomer.  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
\* small to medium. a chihuahua is too small, and a skinny lab is too big. My wife will want to be able to carry the dog if necessary, so it cant be over \~35 pounds  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
\* dont care about shedding. Minimal barking and slobber  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
\* no preference  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
\* mostly snuggly  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
\* eager to please  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
\* nice to strangers. To me, an unnecessary watch dog is a nuisance, not an advantage.  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
\* no  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
\* digging, un-trainable jumping, high-volume licking  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
\* very rarely more than 4 hours. Both spouses work from home   
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
\* our preferences are shared and responsibilities would be shared. There arent any children  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
\* 2 adult cats. Likely will always have at least one cat  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
\* no, but need to be able to occasionally due to children in extended family and with friends  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
\* no maam  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* 80f summer, 25g winter  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

\* when people ask us what kind of dog we want, we often say a cat-like dog . Now, obviously, there are differences (more active needs, attention needs, handholding for day-to-day requirements) but the more chill, the better. Dont want to hear you barking all day or have you ruining all of my stuff or scaring my neighbors. Blend in with the chill household!

2023-10-31,1698715043,So frustrated with finding boarding.,"NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SOME CRAZY SPECIAL BOUTIQUE EXPERIENCE.

I know dog people want the best for their dogs. Im also a dog person, I have two of them and I would probably die for them. 

But boarding is getting out of hand. $50-$75 a day per animal, APPLICATIONS for boarding, required apps, full day temperament tests, required meetings with the owners, mandatory daycare/group play at boarding, packs, report cards, family suites, tuck in times, add on treat packages, tvs in the suites, the list goes on and on. 

Its impossible to find basic boarding. Im not saying the above boarding isnt great for some people, but I have COVID dogs. They dont really want to spend all day playing. One of them I know wouldnt pass the play group temperament test because hes an incredibly anxious dog. When hes boarded, he just lays curled up in the back of his area. I just need someone to keep them eating and drinking and pottying and on their medication schedule, not a damn daycare that has as many requirements as a childrens private school.

Your dogs arent that special and they certainly arent any more special than mine. 

I just want a safe place to keep my dogs when I travel that doesnt cost more than my actual trip. I bring them when I can, but I cant always.",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17k9a6e/so_frustrated_with_finding_boarding/
2023-10-31,1698715259,Help me expand my family,"Slightly long story: in 2010, I adopted a designer dog  a 15 lb cavapoo. He was abused and neglected by his original owner. As a result, he has separation anxiety and is extremely attached to me and my ex-husband. He is very smart. He doesnt like other dogs  in the past 13 years, Ive seen him play with exactly two other dogs. At the dog park, he sits on the bench with the humans. He isnt aggressive, though he does bark at other dogs. But when the other dogs try to sniff him, he runs away (usually behind my legs). He is currently 16 years old, and he needs special food for his kidneys. Hes still a sweet boy, but hes much sleepier than he used to be. My ex and I split custody, three months on, three months off, which seems to work for everyone. 

Now things get sad: My father recently passed on. My mother is not a dog person. She wants to get rid of his dog, an actual mutt. Hes three and weighs 40 lbs. He is dumb as a box of rocks, but he is sweet, and I feel strongly that we should keep my fathers dog within the family. So my mother wants me to take him. Nothing would make me happier. 

Heres where you come in: I have literally NO IDEA how to best introduce the dogs to give them the best chance of getting along. Is it even possible? Is it hopeless? 

For context, my dog is with my ex-husband at the moment. I could just bring my dads dog home and have him already living here when my dog returns from his vacation. Or I could wait until my dog comes home and then introduce the new dog. Or is it a bad idea to bring them together in the house? I honestly have no idea. Help?

2023-10-31,1698717734,Please help me choose the right breed,"Finally figured out the copy/paste on my phone.

  Introduction

1.	`Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Not our first dog. I grew up with dogs my whole life. We had GSDs when I was in middle and high school. I had my own GSD in high school. My wife and I had a Yorkie for 14 years.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

I think I would prefer a breeder, though Im not opposed to rescue. I do want a puppy, and I have some reservations that a rescue puppy may have issues from abuse or neglect. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Great with kids. Active and playful but also content to be a couch potato. Ideally big enough to provide some protection/warning/deterrence for the family/house against those it doesnt know, but not threatening to neighbors or kids. We got used to Yorkie size but Ive had big dogs before, so kind of open. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

We really dont want a dog that sheds but something a bit bigger than our old Yorkie, I think. Ive considered poodle (standard and Moyen), Airedale, Schnauzers, but am open to others Im missing. Also considered the doodle craze but am not convinced on that.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Walk on a leash, fetch maybe, sit, lay on a dog bed, etc. (all the basics). Maybe he could go for a run occasionally. Ideally he could be in the front yard off the leash and not take off running. 

6)    Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

Care Commitments

7)	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I work from home and can work with the dog intermittently. Can commit to distance walking 4-5 times a week. The kids will frequently want to play/wrestle/fetch/tug of war etc. mental stimulation like teaching tricks or playing games I can commit to daily. 

8)	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

See above. Back yard is fenced and fairly large. Fetch, walking, running some, etc.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

We dont want shedding, and our yorkie got regular baths at home but would be shaved by the groomer maybe quarterly? Our kids keep us pretty busy. We trimmed his eyes and such between haircuts. 

Personal Preferences

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

Medium to large, ideally

11)	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I dont want shedding. Would prefer not slobbering either. I dont particularly want a yippy dog, but we just had a yorkie. Funny enough he never learned how to fully bark. His bark sounded like a cough his whole life, which muffled the impact of his yippy barking.

12)	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

In a perfect world, I could sit in the front yard with the dog by my side while the kids play in the cul de sac and not have to worry about him taking off. I realize this requires training - potentially a lot of it. Im not opposed to using a leash in such scenarios.

Dog Personality and Behavior

13)	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A little of both. I dont want it needing to be on me all the time, but the kids and my wife are probably OK cuddling with it.

14)	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Easier to train and happy to please probably works best in our current lifestyle, but Im not terribly opposed to an independent dog. We did just have a terrier. 

15)	How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Watch and maybe a warning bark if it thinks something is unusual. If we let visitors in, Id like the dog to read the situation enough to be friendly to them recognizing were being friendly.

16)	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Not really. Some conflict between dogs is expected but with kids all around I dont want to deal with this.

17)	Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

Nothing really comes to mind. Ideally not a runner if the front door opens and it can take off. Chasing dogs through the neighborhood is a hassle we had to do with the Yorkie from time to time.

Lifestyle

18)	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

There will be times but not usually more than a few hours. We both work from home. Vacations he would either go to a kennel or have a neighbor come take care of him, and in those situations would be alone longer.

19)	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

Sprinkled above. Ill be doing most of the care. My wife will help. Kids will play with it.

20)	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

None currently. Im sure my wife wants a cat but Ive never been an inside cat person.

21)	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes - very much.

22)	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No we own our home.

23)	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Austin, TX - not aware of any prohibited breeds but anything that would make such a list probably need not apply for our situation.

24)	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Well, this past summer was one of the hottest on record regularly reaching triple digits. Winters are usually mild with most days in the 40s or warmer. Some nights will get into the 20s but the dog would be inside.

Additional Information and Questions

25)	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I dont want to spend a ton of money on the dog, but I would prefer a breeder I think.

26)	Feel free to ask any questions below.

2023-10-31,1698768422,"My dog refuses to be touched by anyone, but me","I started fostering a dog about a month ago and was told that she was very very shy. The first 3 days she was afraid of me and wouldn't let me touch her at all without yelping like she was in pain. After 3 days though, she finally let me touch her and now we're very comfortable with each other. The issue is that with my parents she is still scared to do anything with them: sitting next to them, will not feed from their hands, definitely not allowing them to touch her at all too. 

She is comfortable enough at the house and has her little routine when I'm there, but if I leave the house, she starts pooping and peeing on the beds and mats without using the doggy door that I know she's capable of using. Because she's deathly afraid of being touched by anyone else but me, my Mom can't bring her on walks at all. She can't even put the leash on her, and if I put the leash on her, she refuses to walk with my Mom alone (though she has no issues if my Mom and I walk her together). I've tried positive reinforcement, so she'll eat the treats my parents toss her, but how do I get her to become more comfortable with them like she is with me? At least to the point where they could take her on walks comfortably and at least pet her? It's difficult for her and my parents when I'm not there, and I'd really like to develop their relationship.

Now she's very fearful of children (not aggressive at all) and will try and jump up into my arms whenever one approaches.

I don't have any friends with children and also don't want to overwhelm her with too many kids running up and trying to pet her just yet.

However, I really don't want to make any parents or children uncomfortable.

2023-10-31,1698772948,My dog has really long quicks and I need a solution,"Yesterday I spent the day in the ER with my toddler. I thought that my dog bit her in the forehead but it turned out that he got her with one of his claws. It was a freak accident and I should have been more vigilant with those two, but I've entirely changed my approach so these things are less likely to happen.

Anyway, I get my dogs nails trimmed regularly but they can never get them very short because he has really long quicks.

I've read that you can shorten them over time by trimming often but I'm not seeing this type of result. Actually it almost seems as if his quicks are getting even longer over time. Aside from regular nail trimming he gets plenty of walks on asphalt which I guess is supposed to help keep them filed.

When I was looking into my options I read that there are some vets who offer anesthetized quicking, where they use a laser and intentionally cut the quicks way back and then send the pup home with pain meds for a few days.

I've never cut my dog's quick, even on accident but I know this can be painful. As I'm considering my options I'm wondering if having him quicked intentionally would be unnecessarily cruel.

If you've ever cut your dog's quick, was it painful for them for a long time afterwards? Is this something they recover from quickly?

I obviously don't want my dog to suffer unnecessarily, but his claws are always so long they are on the floor when he's walking. I know this can't be good for him. And I also don't want to be in a situation again where my toddler needs stitches. 

I'm keeping the dog and the little one separate like I should have been doing all along. But this whole situation has got me wondering if there is a way to shorten my pup's quicks without hurting him too much or for too long?

2023-11-08,1699483616,Trying to find the right breed,"Introduction
1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
*Its MY first dog but my family owned a dog (Puggle)  growing up I was a main caretaker for. I lived with 2 lab mixes for 2 years that I fed, gave meds, picked up after, let out, took on walks, etc. The main thing I didnt do was buy their food or cover their vet bills since they belonged to my roommate/cousin.
2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
*I would prefer to go through a breeder, mainly so I know their history and that they are healthy.
3) Describe your ideal dog.
*Couch potato, cuddly, enjoys short walks (20-30 minutes). Social with people and dogs. Comfortable with apartment living.
4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
*I love the personality and look of CKCS and Frenchies but because of their health issues Id feel terrible getting one. Ive been looking into Havanese based on other recommendation posts but curious to hear what other breeds Im overlooking that might be a good fit. 
5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
*Basic sit and stay. Would appreciate it if they can grasp heel and basic recall but not super important to me. If they are able to learn other commands that would be amazing but not essential. 
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?
*No
Care Commitments
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
*When Im not at work I am a homebody and love to spend my time relaxing at home. Im happy to spend time playing and will train as much as necessary to get the basic commands understood and keep their mind engaged.
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
*I like to go on short walks after work, about 20-30 minutes. I like going to the dog park with my cousin and her dogs so if thats an environment my dog feels comfortable in I would bring them every week or 2 in the warmer months and they would probably get time in a fenced yard to run to their heart's content at least once a week.
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
*Im happy to brush every day if necessary as well as any regular maintenance. I also am comfortable paying to have grooming done regularly.
Personal Preferences
10) What size dog are you looking for?
*Small, or on the smaller side of medium. But I live in an apartment (800 sq. ft) and dont want a dog to be too big for that amount of space. I want them to feel comfortable and not overly confined.
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
*Low shedding is preferred, but Im also not unfamiliar with being covered in dog hair. Minimal barking because I live in an apartment but Ive also lived with very chatty labs that never bothered me much. Im not big on slobber but if everything else is perfect about a dog its not a deal breaker.
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
*Its not important to me, I cant imagine many scenarios they would intentionally be in that situation. 
Dog Personality and Behavior
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
*I love snuggles, so would prefer a dog who wants to cuddle up at least most of the time. Our dog growing up was very cuddly but liked her personal space too and would take herself to her kennel so Im fine with a similar personality.
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?
*I lean more towards eager-to-please but same as above Im fine with wanting their own space. As long as they arent outwardly defiant Im happy. 
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
*An alert bark is fine if someone knocks on the door. I dont want them losing their mind every time they hear someone walk by the apartment door or window because I live in a main level unit so theres a lot of foot traffic.
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
*Of course, obviously not seeking out a dog like that but not everyone is a people person, and not every dog likes being around other dogs. 
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?
*No.
Lifestyle
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
*I work in the office 3 days a week so Im gone from 7:30 am- 5 (no later than 5:30). Im hoping to move closer to the office so I can at least come home on lunch to give the dog a potty break. I live alone but I have family nearby, both with and without dogs, that will take my dog anytime I would need to be away any longer than that.
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
*None.
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
*No.
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
*Probably not, maybe the occasional interaction once my friends start having kids in the next couple years.
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
*I rent, planning to move to a house in a few years. All small breeds are fine.
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
*Kansas City, no banning on breeds in my area in the size I want.
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
*Summer 85, Winter 45",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qy0zk/trying_to_find_the_right_breed/
2023-11-08,1699473580,Best Dog for Obedience?,"Best dog for me for obedience 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, Ive had a German Shepherd before and I currently own a chow chow and a disabled pomeranian. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Reputable breeder 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Medium or small sized with a disposition for learning commands. My German Shepherd was as smart as a whip; she wanted to learn. My chow has zero drive to learn anything due to her stubbornness. My pomeranian is not capable of learning due to his disability. I miss my German Shepherd that was smart as a whip and ready and willing to learn anything. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Im not really sure which is why Im posting. I know German Shepherds have drive but theyre bigger than I necessarily want. Australian Shepherds I know have drive. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Obedience, but more than sit and lay down. I want them to learn spin, play dead, get a specific toy by name and bring it to me, I want them to learn off leash walking, stay, come, jump, leave it, look, etc.  

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

1-3 hours daily, it varies. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I have a large fenced in yard and a park (not a dog park but dogs are welcome) down the street from me. Mental stimulation toys like puzzles as well. I can walk him or her once a day for at least an hour. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Im the dog groomer for my family and friends. Grooming and brushing is no issue for me. I do prefer dogs with medium or long hair - the slick super short coated dogs arent my favorite like chihuahuas, pit bulls, or blue heelers for example. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium preferably, or small. Not large or extra large. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Some shedding, some or low barking, NO drool. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Its not incredibly important but since I do want a dog I can train I do want them to learn to be off leash. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eagar to please 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I dont really care. My chow is very suspicious of people so Im used to having an aloof dog. I do like how my pomeranian is a friend of the world but it doesnt really matter. She or he will be out with me more in public so maybe not a dog that is super unfriendly. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Nope. I have dogs. I cant have a dog that is aggressive to dogs. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

I own one cat and rabbits. Dog must get along with or at least ignore them. Of course this is something I can and will train them to do. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

6 hours a week or so. Im home 99% of the time 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

Just me. My friend does come over almost daily and she cant tolerate drool either. Besides that she doesnt care obviously. She will likely help train and walk the dog but ultimately the dog is mine and is my responsibility. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Yes I have a chow, a disabled pomeranian, a cat, and rabbits. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No but at the park there will be kids. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

None

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

USA, Missouri 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Missouri is a bitch. It's hot and its cold. It can be 50F one day and 70F the next. Summers are around 90F in the hottest month or so, winters are 25F in its lowest but it really fluctuates. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I have health issues. I have good days and bad days. I need a dog that could skip a walk or two if it had too - again I do have a large fenced in yard and mental stimulation for him or her.

2023-11-08,1699463036,Frustrated greeter,"Hi all

Just looking for help with my nearly 2 year old dog and I suppose a little bit of reassurance! So she absolutely loves other dogs and humans and one issue she has is that when we are going past another dog in the street she will try to pull over to them to say hello. However, we avoid all on lead greetings unless it is a dog she knows well. She will pull over most of the time and I can manage this just by redirecting her gently, however I would say about once a month (its very inconsistent) she will let out a few barks at a dog if she is feeling particularly frustrated. In the past I have dealt with this by basically in the lead up to getting near the dog either hand feeding her or scattering treats as we approach and this leads to her walking past the dog without any reaction.

I suppose I have a few questions.

a)is this all something to be super worried about?
b) is it common?
c) is the way I have dealt with it in the past been rubbish and would you suggest a particular training routine that might help?

2023-11-08,1699466607,yard surface recs for dogs to play/pee/poo etc,"Fellow dog parents,
I have 3 dogs. My latest addition is highly energetic pittie youngster. I am looking for recommendation for good surface to put in the section of my backyard that would tolerate their play and bathroom habits. Most of my yard is paved, but there is a section that is currently just dirt. I let the dogs in the yard in between walks, but they bring all the dirt in the house and I have no time hosing them since they go out in the yard frequently. Initially, I was thinking about putting the grass, but they use that area as bathroom, so I am thinking urine would probably destroy the grass. Now I am thinking putting small stone pebbles, but I am wondering if that would create still lots of dirt and dust that they would bring home. This would be my second estethically ranked option after grass. Finally, synthetic turf, which would maybe tolerate abuse the best and be dustless, but I dont like the look of the turf. Is turf porous to let the urine go through? I am ok with them using that section of the yard for bathroom, it is unavoidable. I am fine cleaning after them every few days and spraying the surface with the water hose. I need to cut down the amount of dirt they bring in because I dont have time to wash them every time I let them out. Please, share your experience. Thank you.",dogs,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17qrj5j/yard_surface_recs_for_dogs_to_playpeepoo_etc/

I read everything about AAFCO, FEDIAF, WSAVA, all the misconceptions etc.  
  
I understand that only 5 brands are WASAVA ""approved"", and Royal Canin is one of them, and it should be enough for me to choose it for my dog.  
  
I came across this Shiba Inu food: https://www.royalcanin.com/mt/dogs/products/retail-products/shiba-inu-adult-dry  
  
The list of ingredients is: **maize**, rice, dehydrated poultry protein, vegetable protein isolate\*, **maize gluten**, animal fats, **maize flour**, hydrolysed animal proteins, beet pulp, soya oil, fish oil, vegetable fibres, minerals, yeasts and parts thereof, fructo-oligo-saccharides, hydrolysed yeast (source of manno-oligo-saccharides), borage oil (0.1%), hydrolysed crustaceans (source of glucosamine), marigold extract (source of lutein), hydrolysed cartilage (source of chondroitin).  
  
Now, I understand the ""don't rely on ingredients list"" statement, because there is a lot of manipulation and marketing, but how can this list be justified as premium product when the first ingredient is maize (even after splitting it into three ingredients), the second is rice and the third is dehydrated poultry protein?  
  
Seems to me that even if I don't understand the ingredients list entirely, at least the first one should be real meat and not maize, no? Otherwise, what's the point of having meat protein? Corn is so cheap that it doesn't make sense to produce something else.  
  
I would appreciate your help.

But now he just keeps pulling his paws away and sitting down and just trying to get out of it, I'm just worried he's going to end up like the other dogs and that I will never never be able to touch his feet. I don't wanna mess him up like I messed up the other dogs. I want him to love having his nails done, but I don't know how to do that. I always have my mom treating him well I do his nails, but apparently it's not working. 

Im having a hard time because I have to take a lot of breaks because Im very impatient and just want to get it done, but I want him to like it. 

I see videos of people with their dogs just perfectly loving their nails being done. 

I know people are just going to say touch his paws and reward! But Ive been doing that, and no difference. 

His nails arent long! Ive been using the dremel because there isnt a whole lot to clip, but you can still feel his nails and they still feel long when he jumps up or even just feeling his paws. 

My other dogs hate having their nails touched so I just gave up, which I always feel guilty  for. My senior gets hers trimmed at the vet, and my others just scratch their paws at sandpaper on a board (which kinda work, but doesnt get them super short and can make some sharp points).

I work in management at a dog boarding facility, we do grooming, boarding, daycare, and we have a trainer. I typically run shifts and delegate tasks, handle the nastier dogs, and administer medications.

Our trainer is about to quit, and I've been offered their position. My employer has offered to send me to school for it, and have me work with our current trainer for a few months before they quit to show me the ropes and take over eventually.

Thing is, while I do have a lot of experience handling dogs, I don't have much experience training them aside from the couple dogs I've owned over the years.

2023-11-07,1699329859,Puppy Breeder Help!,"Hey Everyone,

My wife and I are looking for a puppy and came across these adorable Novia Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever x Poodle puppies. They are from a breeder out in Utah and they have a very large following on social media. The father (poodle) is one of the studs from the breeder and has all OFA records and Embark genetic testing results available. He has a Von Williebrand Type 1 variant according to Embark. It is not serious for him because he only has one copy. Its my understanding if the mother also has one copy, then the puppy can have the disease. The mother(Nova Scotia) has her Embark results still pending and the puppies are ready to go to their new homes this Sunday. She does not have any OFA records. One thing to note as well, this is the first time for this type of liter for the breeder and it seems the first time this breeder has done this crossbreed. The breeder also wants us to put a $500 non-refundable security deposit down to secure the dog. They do come with a one year health warranty. Should I be concerned that we dont have any OFA records on the mother and should I refuse to put down a security deposit until we get the Embark results?

Probably three times a year, she has an upset stomach that cause her to whine and wake me up to go outside during this time frame. However, she is very stubborn and refuses to go right outside of the house. Id even be perfectly fine with her going inside the house. For example, its 1:30 am and I just stood outside with her in my back parking pad for 5 minutes and she refused to go. The moment were back inside she is crying to go out. Im at a loss and feel horrible that she is probably so confused, but I dont feel like I can just walk around until she finds a spot to go. I know she isnt just whining to whine bc when I do cave and walk her for 10+ min, she will go and it is always a loose stool or diarrhea if shes waking me up to go out. 

Is my only solution to just ignore the crying and realize that if she truly has to go she will go? Again, I am not even upset at the idea of her going inside at this point.

The dog is somewhere around 6 month old, female, likely amstaff x ??? cross bread, very sweet and adorable. She's well behaved with humans and other dogs although lacking proper early training it seems as she barely knows to sit or stay on command (learning pretty quickly). From what I understand she was not badly mistreated by previous owner but probably neglected to some extent.

The thing is we have zero experience with dogs and were not expecting to have one, so mostly unprepared and head scratching about the long term implications of having a new furry family member. 

We already have a cat at home and monitoring a slow introduction that is going well. They started to show a keen interest to each other and went as far as making nose contact but I can feel that the dog is struggling with prey dive instincts whenever the cat is jumping around. When would you know it is safe to let them be unsupervised?

I am also wondering about character changes going into adulthood, at the moment she's the nicest of dogs, bonded quickly with us, only playfully bites a bit when cuddling (it is gentle, still trying to take care of that). However I don't know what to expect when growing older. Is character well defined at 6 month already or is it still likely to develop ? I am mostly worried she could express challenging behaviors growing older since we don't have much space left for addressing difficult situations. Obviously we would take education seriously but as I know almost nothing about her genetics I am not sure it is enough to relay on.

Also, my daughter tends to be in and out to her boyfriend's place. Could it be problematic for a young dog to regularly switch between two different homes?

Many thanks in advance for your helpful advice's.

Before staying at the shelter, she was a wild dog that was captured and neutered as part of my countrys efforts to curb the wild dog population. 

The shelter gave her training such as listening to commands and potty training outdoors (she only goes on grass). But herein lies the issue: Ive been trying to train her to be able to go indoors in case of thunderstorms, but it doesnt seem to be working.

So far Ive tried doing positive reinforcement training for the toilet command while were out on walks, but she doesnt seem to want to eat her treats while on walks, so she still doesnt recognise the command.

Ive also tried to keep her in the bathroom during her usual walk/toilet time and asking her to go to the toilet, but she simply sits down on the pee pad, thinking it is a soft mat for her relaxation. 

Any tips on how I can train her to go potty indoors? The end goal should ideally be for her to be able to go to the toilet both outdoors and indoors. Thanks in advance for any tips!",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17pri1s/converting_outdoor_potty_trained_dog_to_indoor/

I grew up with dogs but this will be my first one as an adult.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

Basenji, samoyed, norwich terrier. These 3 all seem to be decent for allergies, active and have fun personalities.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would like my dog to go on runs with me but also be okay in the apartment (I work from home so the dog will not be alone but I don't want it to be barking all day either)

We are open to whatever it takes here

Personal Preferences

10) What size dog are you looking for?

no big preference

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

as long as the dog is hypoallergenic shedding and slobbering are okay. barking we would like to keep to a minimum because we live in an apartment and want to be courteous to our neighbors.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

not important

Dog Personality and Behavior

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

no

we need a dog that is good with other animals and children

2023-11-06,1699272843,How to help a dog I got from the shelter?,"Back story: (not really necessary to read, but relevant I guess) 

So I recently moved in with my cousin and his wife. I come over frequently (were basically brothers)  and got to know the dog before I moved in. Theyve also had another dog for a long time that is a similar breed and wanted to get another dog. The new dog also oddly has very similar name to my mom, Fran 


What I know about the dogs history: 
Age - Between 3-4 years old. 
Spent 18 months in the shelter, went home with two separate families and came back each time. 
The dog has been at the house about 5 months now. 

My assumptions: 
Im going to assume this dog was planned to be used as a hunting dog, and maybe it didnt work out. Some hunters will either kill the dog, or abandon it somewhere. 

The problem: 
Besides being scared easily by loud noises she seems to do well. She will react to someone dropping something. When she gets distracted investigating something in the yard and youre able to sneak up on her she becomes fearful and jumps back real quick and then seems to realize its okay. 

When she is sleeping, or laying down and its quiet and calm and not a lot going on when you get up to grab something (just reach out)  near her she is ready to attack. She has never bitten me, its more like shes worried I mean harm and I caught her off guard so she wants me to go away. She does this with my cousin too. The thing I find odd is shes aware of who we are and what are smells are like and still does it. For example, shell sleep with my cousin and his wife. My cousin will get up in the middle of the night to piss and when he comes back shes snaps at him. 


Last time she did it to me, it was like she collapsed her front legs on the couch as if she knew she was wrong. A lot of times after these events she seems to come to you and sort of apologize. She has never actually  bitten me once and if she really wanted to she could have several times. 

Outside of that one small thing shes a great dog.


I figured in time the issue would be fixed. Were all nice people, treat her great. When these events happen we kinda stand there and try and let her know its ok and we dont mean harm. Kinda try to pet her and comfort her. Is the last part proper or should we handle it differently? I dont know if she understands, or if it would be seen as rewarding the dog?",dogs,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17p1d3c/how_to_help_a_dog_i_got_from_the_shelter/

But when she does iniate play I always make sure to stop it as you can see it scares them as she is very big. That being said she's not relentless she doesn't chase them or try to play with them all the time, as she's more interested in her own toys and us, I like to put that to spending alot of time trying to twach her to relax around the flat and the cats.

Ziki always used to hiss and occasionally swat at her but recently he has started to attack her for what seems to be no reason, he can open doors, he will open the door saunter in, look at her and then just launch himself, he doesn't make a noise just starts attacking her, we kept stopping it and just making the cat leave the room, now ziki never use to come.into the living room, he would always chill in the bedroom, but since we've had the dog he comes in, the dog used to bother ziki when she was younger (by bowing and then just going crazy) but we nipped that in the bud through separating  them and redirecting her unto toys or through telling her to sit or go to place etc...

Anyway, last night I was cleaning the skirting in the hallway so took the dog with me, she poked her nose into the kitchen but then her ears like flattened and she started to walk backwards really quick, until she got to my.legs. It was at this point ziki has come into the doorway, looked at her and then just sprinted towards her attacked her and then ran off back to the kitchen, she was a bit nervous so I told the dog to sit and started to feed her for listening and staying with me, them when I told her to go into the living room, the cats turned around and gone crazy, flipping and spinning with his claws out, all aiming at the dogs chest and face. As I went to stop it the dog has lowered her face and bared her teeth towards his knape. I separated and crated her (I don't know if this was the right course of action but its all I knew to do in the moment), then today while I've been at college he's attacked the dog again and my partner has rung me crying because she'd left the room for about a minute just to.go.toilet, she'd closed the living room door but when she got back the door was open, she could hear then fighting and the dog was pinning the cat with her paws, as in paws on his neck and chest holding him in place as he went nuts.

We live in a flat that is quite spacious, but we're on the list waiting on a 2 bedroom house, we get the dog out alot and mentally and physically exercise her as she is a doberman and needs that. After doing reading i do realise thay this is probably all my fault as i wanted a dog but A we live in a flat and B we already had 2 cats.

The only time ziki comes into the living room he will attack her, he never use to go in before we got the dog, and at this point we're regretting it as I don't want the dog to end up hurting him, and ideally I don't want to rehome the dog, call it selfishness but I love her and I don't want to have to get rid of her, when she could end up somewhere bad and she's really bonded with me, I've never felt this type of.love from any animal its so strange and I need advice om how to fix this, is it fixable by training at home or I do look.for a specialist, don't be afraid to criticise me at all, I feel like shit, my partner feels like shit but at the end of the day it is what it is and I just need to try and fix this.

Thank you for contacting Purina.

With increased demand and a temporary supply constraint of the probiotic ingredient we use in our formulas, weve taken a proactive step to ensure product availability by removing probiotics. Providing the highest quality and safety standards remains the top priority for all Pro Plan dog foods.

2023-11-06,1699296309,Question about deposits&,"Hi there! So we put a deposit on a German Shepherd litter, we initially said we would be fine with either a male or female but made it clear we were very much hoping for a female. When the puppies were born there were not enough females born for us and we started having doubts, but the breeder said since she has top pick of the litter she is most likely to drop out. So we kept our spot, hoping she would not take the female. She also said we could transfer our deposit to a future litter (this is important).

Well the pups turned 3 weeks old and the breeder strongly hinted towards her wanting to keep the female. I told her we have decided not to go with a male and would rather wait for a future female. The breeder told us the deposit is only transferrable until theyre 2 weeks old so we would have to place a separate deposit if the male puppy doesnt get adopted before 8 weeks.

We are pretty distraught about this and were wondering if this was normal? I am well aware that deposits are non-refundable but we are not asking for it back, we merely would like it transferred. We have bought 4 purebred cats from reputable breeders so we are familiar with the process but have never heard of it. I am trying to understand her point of view but I fail to. I also wanted to mention that we did not sign a contract and there is no mention of this on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

Introduction  
  
Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be mine and my partners first dog as adults but we both grew up with dogs (him BCs, me working and show line labs and ex racing grey hounds) and are our family and friends go to for dog sitting so we have looked after bull terriers, golden retrievers, spaniels and rescue mutts  
  
Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

We would like to go to a reputable breeder.

  
Describe your ideal dog.  
  
What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Old English Sheepdog - I love to groom animals so the ultra long hair appeals to me, they have the smarts, desire to please and energy of working breeds but are almost exclusively showline in the UK so are a bit 'softer'.

Flat coated retriever - I adore retrievers but my other half wants to try something a little different (as we have been around a load of labs and goldens). I think a flat coat fits this bill, plus they are a little less push button than a lab or golden which appeals, I like a bit of sass in my animals. 

White swiss Shepard - We both adore German Shepards but are not sure we'd be able to handle that much dog, from research white swiss seems to be very similar to GSDs (smart, driven, loyal, energetic) but a notch or two down from a GSD. Bonus points that they are a 'grumble-y' breed and we both love chatty animals.

Other half is dead set against a lab or golden, having been around a lot of them he likes them but says they don't feel like the right breed for him, he can't articulate why but he feels it in his soul. I don't want a terrier or Sighthound, similar to my other half I just don't vibe with them as much as I like them.   
  
What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Basic obedience and solid recall are must haves. We are toying with the idea of training the dog to help with my ADHD (get me my meds and help to interrupt hyper focus and overstimulation).  
  
Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

I wouldn't want to compete but I would want to take part, I'm not fussed what we do (agility/flyball/rally ect.) I just want an activity that I can do with a doggy partner and have some fun and social time.  
  
Care Commitments  
  
7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Realistically we can dedicate up to 4 hours throughout the day.   
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

We can do 1-2 hours of off leash sniffing/running in the nearby country parks during the week and longer on the weekend. Ultimately looking for a hiking buddy, we live near the peak district and I want to spend as much time as possible there when the dog is old enough.   
  
9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I adore brushing, it's not the same but we have a long haired cat (half persian) and grooming him is one of my favourite activities, I could do it until he was bald.   
  
Personal Preferences  
  
10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large, no smaller than a Border collie  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Don't mind shedding, house is covered in cat hair anyway. I don't mind a bit of barking but don't want to p-off the neighbours. Prefer less slobber but if it's for the right dog then sign me up to become a walking tissue  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important, the vast majority of exercise will be off leash in the semi-rural area around my house  
  
Dog Personality and Behavior  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Snuggly.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Eager to please, but I would like a little bit of sass, not 100% push button  
  
15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would prefer if they were friendly or at least accepting of strangers  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, lots of family and friends have dogs so we need a dog that will be ok with other dogs  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

We've got two cats, whilst the house is catified so they can get up and escape we would prefer if the dog wasn't constantly chasing them  
  
Lifestyle  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

I work from home 3-4 days a week, on the days that I am in the office the dog will be alone from 8:30-17:30 and we will get a dog sitter to come in once or twice during the day.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

My other half, he will be an equal partner and really wants a dog as well.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We have two young cats.   
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No, but we would like to have children one day and we do live in a very family friendly place so there will be children around on walks.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Own our home  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

The UK, banned breeds are:

Pit bull type dogs

Japanese Tosa

Dogo Argentino

Fila Brasileiro

XL bully (from next year)  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
Summer - 20 degrees Celsius, winter - 0 degrees Celsius   
Additional Information and Questions  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I travel for work and am away for 3-7 days a month, during this time my other half will look after the dog, he is less interested in serious training so not a dog that needs a job or real challenge every day.

4. About 1/2 of the drained water is poured onto a lick mat, then frozen

2023-11-06,1699275290,First dog recommendations,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
\* Yes, this will be my first dog. I have looked after dogs for friends and neighbours but never for more than a week. This has included older rescue dogs with lots of anxiety and young retriever/labrador puppies. I've never had one myself though.  
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  
  
\* I'm more inclined to rescue, as all my previous pets have been rescues and I'd prefer to help out a dog in need of a home. However, I'm aware I'm not experienced with the possible behaviour and needs of rescue dogs and could potentially avoid this by raising and training my own puppy, so that is also a consideration.  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
\* A dog I can take on long walks during the day and cuddle up with at night. They'd need to eventually be okay with being alone for a few hours at a time, but this can be built up. I'd prefer minimal slobber, but am okay with grooming &amp; shedding.  
  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
\* I'm open to the majority of breeds. I've not had great experiences with tiny breeds and would prefer something slightly larger than a Chihuahua, up to around the size of a Labrador. I'd like to avoid breeds with known respiratory issues like pugs. I've spent time with a friend's Border Collies and adored their intelligence, stamina, and affection. I'm not convinced I could give a Border Collie the physical and mental stimulation they need, unfortunately.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
\* I'd love to train them to have near perfect recall. Basic obedience training and being able to wait patiently to greet guests as well.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
\* No.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
\* I'd like to spend the majority of my time with my dog. I work from home 4 days a week and would be able to hire a dog walker or use a dog daycare for the day I am at work. While I should have plenty of time to dedicate to my dog, I would like an hour or so a day of rest where I can trust my dog to not get too mischievous.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
\* I'm open to 2-3 x 1-hour long walks a day during the week. I usually go out for longer walks or bike rides at the weekend and a hike once a month or so. I have a few parks that are a 30-minute walk away (or a quick drive to) that I'd enjoy going to a few times a week. I have a medium garden they can run around in too.   
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
\* I'm willing to do daily brushing and whatever grooming needs to be done regularly.   
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
Ideally, something around the size of a spaniel, though I'm flexible. I do have family members who visit occasionally and have a fear of dogs, so preferably nothing bigger than a Labrador. I'm also around 5'5"" and would prefer a dog that can't overpower me.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
\* I'm okay with lots of shedding. I can handle some barking and slobber but would prefer these to be minimal.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
\* In an ideal world, I'd love to have the freedom to do this. My garden is surrounded by hedges and is unlikely entirely dog-proof currently. I am happy to use temporary fencing so they can run around if need be. I would love the ability to go on long walks or hike with an off-leash dog but this isn't a requirement.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
\* I'd like somewhere in the middle. I'd enjoy cuddles, but it might be too much to have a dog that clings to me constantly.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
\* I'm okay with either.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
\* As my family and best friend both have some fear of dogs, I'd like them to be able to wait patiently to greet them and not jump up on them. Some reaction to door-knocking is okay but I'd prefer them not to go crazy.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
\* To an extent. I'm happy to keep dog interactions to a minimum but I'm aware I'm not experienced and don't wish to take on more than I can handle.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
\* I'd like to avoid people agression if possible.  
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
\* At most 2-3 hours a day with the exception of one day a week. I work 8 hours in an office one day a week but am willing to enlist a dog walker or daycare. I can also likely be with the dog for 30 minutes over lunch. There may be occasions of more like 4-6 hours but any longer and I would ensure someone would be there for them.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
\* I live alone and will take on all caring responsibilities.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
\* I have 5 guinea pigs. Should the dog prove calm enough and ignore them, I'm okay with having them in the room while I'm there. At all other times the door to their room will be locked and inaccessible to the dog, possibly always should I not be comfortable with any interaction. This would depend on the dog's temperament but cats are a possibility in the future. This isn't essential, but having grown up with cats, I'd like my own one day.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
\* Unlikely.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
\* I rent from family members and expect to keep doing so until I can have my own house. There are no restrictions on my lease.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
\* I live in Scotland, and there are a few breeds with bans. These are;

Pit bull terrier type.  
Japanese Tosa type.  
Dogo Argentino type.  
Fila Braziliero type.  
Any other type of dog appearing to be or to have characteristics of the above type bred for fighting.

It is unclear whether the UK ban on XL bully dogs will apply to Scotland but I would also avoid this type.  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
\* 15-17°C (or 59-63 °F) in the summer, 5°C (41°F) in the winter.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
\* I'm still very much in the planning stage and it's not a guarantee I'll be getting a dog, or that it'll be in the near future. I'm doing as much research as I can to see how a dog would fit into my lifestyle and appreciate any advice I get.

2023-11-05,1699153270,Breed suggestion for apartment dog,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No - grew up with dogs my entire childhood. Had a Pointer-Poodle mix, then a Labrador-Husky mix and two Canaan dogs, then a Viszla mix.

While this will be the first dog that is solely my responsibility, I have taken care of my mom's current Vizsla mix for a few months while she was traveling, and generally have been very involved in training and caring for our dogs.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

Have had bad experience with rescue dogs - my mom's current Viszla mix came with very bad separation anxiety and aggression towards other dogs that we have simply not been able to fix.

Going to go with a reputable breeder this time, though I don't care much about lineage prestige as much as the parents being mild mannered and appropriate for my lifestyle.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Medium sized - not too small for a bit of roughhousing, but not too big to be a hassle when living in an apartment.

Living in a city apartment and not having a back yard, high energy is probably a bit much. I do work from home and am looking forwards to morning and afternoon walks, definitely about an hour a day at a minimum. Would take it on a long (2 hr) run on the weekends as well occasionally.

I've noticed that I get slightly allergic around dogs that shed a significant amount so ideally not a big shedder.

A tendency to bark a lot could also be a problem, as I live in an apartment.

Living in a city, a social dog that is well trained for recall and outdoor dining is a must. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I really love pointer breeds, having grown up with them. They are incredibly loving and fun to train. From looking into this online, sighthounds seem to be a good option as well. What I've looked at so far and my reservations are:

Vizsla, GSP, American/English Foxhounds, Red Coondogs - may require too much exercise to keep in the city with my lifestyle. Worried about recall when doing off-leash hours at the park, since these are hunting/hound dogs. Really love them otherwise tho.

Whippet - seems to be a good match in terms of energy, shedding, size, personality. The only reservations with these are that they seem a bit frail. I've read that they can be apprehensive at dog parks and city environments.

English/Welsh Springer Spaniel, Brittany - all seem like good fits size and energy wise, they're pretty cute. Not sure if they shed too much or not and how social &amp; trainable they tend to be.

Also open to any other suggestions.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Most important is:
- recall
- staying home alone without causing a mess (obviously within reason with respect to time)
- socializing with other dogs/not being aggressive towards them
- not barking too much or jumping on guests as they open the door
- not begging for food

Would be nice to have a dog that is generally amenable to more advanced training and communication.

A dog that is comfortable swimming/in water is also a plus.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Looking forward to investing time in properly training and communicating with the dog. I work from home so will generally be present and can do short training sessions/give attention throughout the day.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

At least two walks a day, for a about an hour total minimum. More on the weekends.
Live right by a dog park that we'll probably go to a lot.
My partner would like to take the dog on her runs.

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Not looking for anything too intense but once or twice a week of grooming the dog seems fine. Obviously willing to pay a profesional for related services.

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium, or a larger small dog. Probably around 30-50 lbs and 17-25"" tall.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Trying to avoid a dog that sheds too much.
I live in an apartment so barking should be relatively minimal as well.
Not a fan of slobbery dogs.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Important - I live near a park that has off-leash hours and don't have a private back yard so this would be their primary source of exercise besides the fenced dog park.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Leaning towards snuggly. I love Vizslas who are obviously velcro dogs.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

Somewhere in the middle? Looking to spend a good amount training the dog, but working from home it would also need to be able to spend time on its own when I'm around.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I've had dogs that jump at guests and that gets annoying very quick. Should be trained to wait for permission to greet the guests at the door or something like that. Other than that, they dog should be comfortable with guests and visitors (both humans, children, and dogs).

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

The main one is that they must obey recall - a dog that wanders off away and gets lost is a big nightmare.
Other than that, excessive barking, not being able to stay home alone, aggression towards other dogs, excessive anxiety, chewing furniture, must be house trained.
I feel like most of these are up to training them young, though.

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Occasionally for an evening when meeting friends, but I work from home so will be there with the dog most of the time.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My partner wants a dog too. She is active and wants an active friend to do active things with. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

No.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not really.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Rent, no restrictions.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

New york city, not aware of laws banning breeds I've looked at.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Summers can be 70-90 degrees and winters can be 20-40 degrees, but its usually somewhere in the middle.",dogs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17o2txf/breed_suggestion_for_apartment_dog/

2023-11-04,1699136642,Is it okay to move and separate our dogs?,"Is it okay to separate our dogs?

My partner and I got two dogs together. We got the first one (allie) as a 3 months old, raised her to be about a year old and then got the second one (ash) also as a 3 month old.

They lived together now for about 2 years and seem to love hate each other. If one of us moved with only one of the dogs, will that cause trauma? Here are a few of their behaviors:

Possibly bonded:
- when taking one for a walk the left behind one will cry/whine 
- play with each other well
- interact with each other first when let out of crates
- good to eat food in the same room
- lick each others faces/ears at times
- sleep in proximity of each other (also on same human bed)
- when we moved and ash arrived in the new place first she was distraught until Allie arrived

Possible reason they may not be bonded:
- dont like sharing toys (but try to take which ever they dont have, goes both ways)
- ash started to growl to defend her toys/treats
- playing is pretty one sided (Allie most of the time is dominating play) while ash seems weary at times
- when walked together they are visibly more anxious/hyper
- nervousness from ash when Allie approaches her sometimes 


Do you think these dogs would be okay by themselves? I think Allie would be fine but ash never lived without a dog around

TLDR:
Okay to split dogs that seem to tolerate each other well most of the time?",dogs,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17nx9fy/is_it_okay_to_move_and_separate_our_dogs/
2023-11-04,1699135016,"Small, chill breeds needed!","\*\*Introduction\*\*  
  
1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  
  
No! We own an almost 10 year old pug, we fostered a mudi puppy a few years back, and I grew up around the family boxers and my grandpa's LGDs.   
  
2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?  
  
Reputable breeder, we need a predictable temperament. Also shelters here are filled with lurchers and greyhounds, collies, terriers, bully mixes, spaniel crosses, so many larger doodles, and for some reason a shit ton of frenchies, none of which would really work for us.  
  
3)	Describe your ideal dog.  
  
We really want a dog that is similar to our pug because she fits in our lifestyle perfectly, but finding an actual, reputable breeder breeding healthy pugs that can do all of the things dogs love to do without risks to their health is like searching for a needle in a haystack, hence this post.

Our ideal dog is super cuddly, we love the little velcro shadows, ready for adventures but can take a chill day or two, happy-go-lucky, small and needs to travel well (both car and cabin in the plane), and ideally a bit less stubborn than our current girl but not a deal breaker. 

  
4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  
  
We love our pug, so we thought ""why not just get another pug?"", but the breeder of our first isn't breeding anymore, and I think it would be so hard to find another breeder that prioritizes health above all else and can actually prove it. I don't even know where to start searching. We're in Europe though where there are various pushes for ""healthy pugs"", but I feel like it's so hard to find the ones who are actually reputable, and not just breeding random mixes to get ""rare"" colors under fancy names like ""retromops"" and the guise of longer snouts automatically means better with no regards to anything else.

Our prime next breed candidate is a Japanese Chin. Everything we read about them seems to fit in great, but I don't actually have any personal experience with the breed. They seem like they would match our pug's personality great and they seem healthier overall, but I'd love to hear from someone with more experience.

We also looked at Cavaliers King Charles Spaniels, they seem PERFECT in every way, but they are also so unhealthy as a breed that we might as well just get a pug in that case. Can we even find a reputably bred one, given how common heart issues are in the breed? They are also on our upper limit size wise.

We know of a very reputable Chihuahua breeder, but I've met so many Chis with anxiety and resource guarding issues that I'm wary.

Poodles and the bichon family are out, I tried hard but my partner just can't get over his dislike of their look. Also no terriers, we are not a terrier family.  
  
5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  
  
Basic obedience is expected is this house, but I believe every dog can be trained to know how to behave in society and learn some cute tricks on the side. We'd adjust to the dog's personality from there.  
  
6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  
  
Again we'd adjust to the dog but no grand plans to be agility champions or anything like that. Our pug for example LOVES scent work believe it or not. We'd be happy to try conformation shows again with the right dog, but not a deal breaker if it doesn't happen.  
  
\*\*Care Commitments\*\*  
  
  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  
  
I expect multiple smaller 5-10 minute training sessions per day, we'd adjust to the attention span of New Dog. Someone is working from home almost every day, so it's easy to fit in. We do at least some puzzle toys or treat hide-and-seek daily with our pug as well, and when she's in the mood we fit in some tug and general roughhousing too. A lot of cuddles to be expected, as well as grooming sessions to bond.  
  
8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    
  
Our pug gets about an hour of sniffy walks a day, usually a portion of it off leash, and usually more on the weekends because we have everything from beaches to mountains within a 30 minute drive. If the weather is super shit our pug is happy to do only 30 minutes though, as long as we don't chain multiple days in a row. We tried doing more with our pug but she disliked the flirt pole and doesn't care about fetch, but we're happy to bring any of these back for New Dog. No dog parks near us, and I don't like them anyway.  
  
9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  
  
We can do both, as much as the dog needs. We're used to nail dremels, cleaning ears and nose folds, baths, clipping of butt feathering, brushing.   
  
\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  
  
10)	What size dog are you looking for?  
  
Small, needs to be airplane cabin size friendly because we live in Ireland and planes are the only efficient way to reach the mainland, and as expats we plan to spend at least a month each summer back home and don't want to leave the pups behind.  
  
11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  
  
We have a pug, shedding is our life, a robot vacuum exists for a reason. Barking would ideally be on the lower side, we live in a city after all. No slobber.  
  
12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  
  
Would be preferred where there is no traffic or livestock once proper recall is trained, but not a deal breaker.  
  
\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
  
13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  
  
Give me all the snuggles, this is probably the biggest priority for us, we demand a cuddly dog.  
  
14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?  
  
I love me a dog that wants to learn, but isn't too smart for their own good. Our pug is so smart and stubborn that she really tested all I knew about dog training before because she is really hard to motivate properly, so I'd prefer a dog that's a bit more eager-to-please if possible, but definitely no need for a high achiever that always needs a job.  
  
15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    
  
We have people over often, alert barks are fine but we want friendly dogs.  
  
16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  
  
No, hard deal breaker, we don't want to risk our current dog, and we live in a city where there are dogs everywhere and they need to be able to coexist peacefully in public.  
  
17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?  
  
We're just looking for another chill, happy-go-lucky pup, so we are trying to avoid breeds prone to anxiety overall. We'd also prefer a dog with a natural off switch, our mudi foster didn't have one and as rewarding as raising her until she was ready to go to her forever home was, she was definitely all the proof we needed that we prefer a dog that isn't always in GO GO GO mode.   
  
\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
  
18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  
  
As an adult probably 6 hours max once or twice a week when we both need to go to the office or go out somewhere we can't take the dogs, hybrid working means usually someone is home most of the time.  
  
19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   
  
My partner and I equally share dog caring duties, although I'm usually the primary puppy trainer.  
  
20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  
  
A senior, spayed pug. No other animals, no plans to get any.  
  
21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  
  
Not right away, but we and all of our friends of prime children having age so probably yes in the future.  
  
22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  
  
No restrictions, we are in the process of buying a house so no puppy until that is done.  
  
23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  
  
Dublin, Ireland. There are restrictions on some breeds like pit bulls, but no bans (yet).  
  
24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  
  
Mild summers, usually not hotter than 25 degrees Celsius, mild but windy and damp winters, usually not colder than 5 degrees Celsius at the worst.  
  
\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  
  
25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  
  
We're mainly interested in what you all think of our breed list, and if there are any breeds we've missed to consider. We're at the right time to start researching breeders and getting on a waiting list with the goal to get this puppy in a year or two.

now heres the issue. 
i live really far from where i go to college (2h commute one way so 4h daily) and im in stem so its a busy day. we were looking to live directly to the town where my uni is and get our own apartment and the dog is meant to be my christmas gift from my boyfriend even though i offered to go dutch and pay half or a portion at least because it doesnt feel fair even tho its my gift. 

we wont be moving til after christmas and im not sure how long my boss can keep the puppy with him after we buy it off of him. its also a lot considering wed be moving 2h ours away and getting a puppy on top of that. but this opportunity its a once in a blue moon kind, a perfect litter of my dream dog at a discounted rate just because he likes us and we work well for him.

* friendly, CUDDLY, relatively low-energy, we arent super active but the dog will be taken out 3-4 times a day + trips to our small dog park daily. will need to be well-suited for living in an 800 sqft apt w me &amp; bf. no kids/pets of our own for foreseeable future but would prefer a dog that gets along with them! will need to be left alone for 4-6 hours, 3 times a week maximum.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* greyhounds, whippets, or italian greyhounds. ive heard sighthounds, are are good for apartment living. although ive heard iggys are notoriously tough to housebreak which doesnt sound great to me. maybe some type of poodle or poodle mix due to their friendly nature &amp; lack of shedding. the shedding with my silky soft beagle was absolutely INSANE.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* basic obedience commands such as sit, stay, get down, come, dont eat off plates, alerting me when they need to go out (our beagle rang a bell) &amp; maybe a few basic tricks like paw, roll over, etc.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not really my interest.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* as much time as i can, although honestly im not certain what the requirement is. my bfs work is seasonal so hes home most days &amp; im home about half of the day

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 3-4 walks a day + a trip to a small dog park daily. a trip to a larger dog park 1-2x a week? 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* im okay with brushing, i used to brush 2x a week but couldve stood to do it more. id clean ears, &amp; groom at home. (the elderly purebred beagle had a wholeeee host of health issues that i cared for in her final years.) for trims for long coat i might prefer a professional for a better final product &amp; would be willing to pay.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* small-medium ideally, but no bigger than a greyhound.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* shedding, minimal to medium, definitely nothing extreme like a golden. minimal barking since i live in an apartment. minimal slobber if possible.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* not crucial, but would be nice especially if i get a dog that likes to sprint &amp; stretch its legs.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* snuggly, so very clingy. i love dog affection, i never get tired of it &lt;3 &amp; its a big help with my mental health

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one thats more eager-to-please?

* eager-to-please

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* i dont mind barking at knocking (gated complex so knocking is rare), but definitely friendly upon meeting strangers

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We frequently pass dog neighbors entering/exiting our apt. &amp; Our dog will interact with my bfs parents 2 dogs (separate households) from time to time.

17) Are there any other behaviors you cant deal with or want to avoid?

* Extreme shedding, extreme barking (love hounds but theyre a no for right now =*), a need for several hours of exercise daily. high aggression. Breeds that are frequently banned from apartment complexes if we ever want to move (Pitbulls, german shepards, staffordshires, etc). i dont think i want one of those white dogs that always looks dirty lol although theyre very sweet

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* at a maximum, 4-6 hours, 2-3x a week but generally less.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* bf &amp; i both love dogs &amp; he is home all day most days so will be more involved in caretaking. we visit our parents a lot, &amp; my parents will ONLY allow me to visit with the dog if it is house trained, well-mannered, obeys commands &amp; minimal shedding. so a dog that could fit this bill &amp; come hang out with the family would be amazing but not a deal breaker.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* None of our own until we buy a house in several years. BFs mom has dachshund-schnauzer mix, bfs dad has labradoodle (25-30 lbs). they will definitely interact from time to time.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not regularly, but may occasionally see my 9, 4, &amp; 2 y/o nephew &amp; nieces, who are all kind &amp; sort of indifferent to dogs. One nephew is allergic so a more hypoallergenic dog would be a massive plus.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Currently rent, no weight restrictions but restrictions on breeds known for aggression such as pitbulls, staffordshires, german shepards, dobermans, etc.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* fall-spring in DFW (none) &amp; summer in Denver (restrictions on pitbulls &amp; dogs in that family)

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* summer 80-105, winter 40-50

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Ive heard senior dogs can be well suited for apartment living, my only qualm is that i lost my 15 y/o beagle early this year &amp; idk if i can bring myself to sign up for that heartache so much sooner after getting a dog. ): but on the other hand senior dogs need love &amp; a forever home too!! &amp; it sounds like were a great fit for one. Im highly conflicted in this aspect.

2023-11-04,1699102650,Traveling with large dogs,"Hi everyone! I have a great pyrenees and australian cattle dog mix who weighs roughly 70lbs and we take frequent short trips together (ranging from a few days to a week max). When we do travel, he sleeps in a 36 crate which is definitely tight, but he makes it work. In the car he travels in the doggy hammock with a seat belt. Im getting a bigger car so Im looking at some options to help make it a little more comfortable when we take trips together. 

How do you all travel with your large dogs and what do their sleeping arrangements look like? As of right now Im considering either keeping my current transport setup and getting a 42 crate or getting a large sized Gunner crate for transport and sleeping. I know the Gunner route would definitely be the safer bet given if anything were to happen to us, but my only concern is the inner dimensions are a little smaller length and width wise compared to a 36 crate. I know travel crates are supposed to be a little snug for safety reasons but I just want my dog to be comfortable when were staying at places =-. Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!",dogs,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17nl425/traveling_with_large_dogs/
2023-11-03,1699048005,Dog friendly airline suggestions besides Southwest?,"We fly bi-annually with our dog on Southwest to visit family in our hometown (in the US, 2K+ miles one way). While our pet travel experience with Southwest has been good, we dislike most other aspects of flying with them. Now that they raised their pet fee, we're considering other options. Would love to know which airline was your best dog travel experience?

Info on our dog for ref: 14lb Chipoo-Yorkie mix, fits comfortably in an 18x11x11 carrier. She can easily stand up and turn around, but will touch the carrier ""roof"" when she stands/turns at full height. She doesn't like flying/the airport but is a quiet flyer, makes no noise and stays in her carrier the whole time as required. She won't really stand and turn on command. We're basically looking for airlines where, if your carrier is the standard size, your dog is behaving normally, and it's not filling the carrier wall to wall, the check in/boarding agent is not going to give you a hard time.",dogs,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/17n6018/dog_friendly_airline_suggestions_besides_southwest/
